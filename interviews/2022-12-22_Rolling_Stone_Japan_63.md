Band-Maid went on their first US tour in three years, Band-Maid US Tour 2022, for about a month in October 2022, and finished the 14 shows in total successfully while selling out venues one after another. On the first day of the tour, they performed at Aftershock Festival, a big music festival in California, US, and on November 6, after returning to Japan, they performed as a supporting act for the Guns N’ Roses Japan Tour at Saitama Super Arena. They moved closer to their goal of world domination in the fulfilling second half of 2022. In this interview, they told us episodes on the US tour to the fullest.

- First of all, could you tell us about your appearance at Aftershock Festival 2022 in Sacramento, California?

Kobato: That was our first time performing in person at an overseas music festival, if we don’t count our online appearance before. I was happy I saw more and more people gather as we went on playing each song on stage, po.

Saiki: That festival was our first serving (concert) in a long time where cheering was allowed, so I was like “This is awesome!” The refreshing feel still stands out in my memory. Akane, you had a conversation with the audience with your drums, right?

Akane: As soon as I started to play after the stage change, they got excited beyond comparison with Japan. I played like boom bang boom bang and they were like “Ohh!” (laughs) They were very assertive and it was so much fun.

Band-Maid

- How did you decide the setlist of the first in-person serving in a long time?

Saiki: We had decided to start with From now on, and played songs we wanted them to hear now straightforward. We didn’t know what kind of environment the festival itself would be like, so we mainly chose songs that would get ourselves excited. The last song, NO GOD, was a huge hit at the Pre US Tour servings, and we realized it shines so much at servings, which was a great discovery. The song already felt good when we made it, but it turned out to be better than our expectation.

- Kanami-san, do you have any memories of Aftershock Festival 2022?

Kobato: Your headdress came off, right?

Kanami: Usually I wear my headdress much more tightly, but I guess it was loose that day and it came off. Personally I didn’t intend anything at all, but there was a lot of reaction after that.

Saiki: They saw it as if you took it off because you were excited like “I’ve had it!” and “Hey! Let’s roll!” (laughs)

Kobato: Your way of taking it off was cool, po. Also, it was way hotter than we expected, po, right? My equipment went down a few times because of the heat, and I was like “My sound doesn’t come out, po!” I would have panicked before, but I was able to switch myself like “It’s OK if it doesn’t come out, po!” I think that’s because our masters and princesses (fans) were excited with loud cheers and it was fun, po.

Band-Maid

- Misa-san, how about you?

Kanami: You couldn’t take off your shoes, right?

Misa: Oh, yeah. I usually go barefoot, but the American sunlight was so intense and I couldn’t stand on stage without shoes at all. After finishing it, our faces were as red as a lobster (laughs). I think we all had headache.

Akane [note: corrected from “Misa”]: This year, we finally did servings and also performed at music festivals in Japan, but they were all indoors. I was feeling nostalgic when we played in the dusty outdoor environment under the direct sunlight.

Kobato: We were affected by the wind for the first time in a while, po, right?

Saiki: Like “Oh, the sound went off! The wind is so strong.”

Kanami: We were all talking about how good it was for us to start with Aftershock.

- Were your staff members locals?

Kobato: Our roadies and other concert staff came with us from Japan. Our driver was an American, and a Japanese interpreter living there helped us, po.

- Did you travel by bus basically?

Kobato: We traveled by bus and we lived in the bus, po. The bus was a type with beds, so all of us including our staff, 14 people in total, basically traveled together on the same bus, po.

- Was it the kind of tour bus you often see in movies?

Kobato: Yes, it was, po. It was a huge version of tour bus, po (laughs).

Saiki: It was bigger than any other bus I’ve ever seen. Our tour manager who lives in LA and joined over there was like “You don’t see this kind of bus often”.

Kobato: It was so big it would be impossible to drive on Japanese roads, po. It was huge both in width and in length, po.

Misa: And in height. It was a double‐decker.

Kobato: It had a small kitchen and a restroom properly, and also a space to eat together.

- So your traveling environment was rather good than hard.

Kobato: It was by far the best, po. Before, we had a hard time moving as we were crammed in a van with our gear, grasping our knees, so this time the bus was luxurious like heaven, po. We really appreciated that there was a bed for each of us and we were able to travel while sleeping there in the night, po.

- Speaking of the environment, I sometimes hear that the sound changes according to the climate or the voltage, but how was it actually?

Kobato: In the past tours, there were actually a lot of accidents such as the power going off and white smoke coming out of my amp, po. But this time most of the venues had very good environments and the sound was really great, po.

Saiki: We went around almost twice as many venues as we had done in the past, and thankfully the venues were higher-grade than before, so their facilities were totally different.

Kanami: Before, we sometimes rented amps on site, but this time they carried the same equipment in a dedicated gear van for all the shows for us, so I really appreciated we were able to use the same amps all through.

Saiki: We also rented a mixing desk for the PA system. That helped us a lot, right? We always had the same sound from our IEMs. It was fun because I actually felt we had stepped up our stage. That made me want to play at even bigger venues.

Kobato: I think it was a very satisfying tour sound-wise compared to our past US tours and other overseas tours, po.

Band-Maid

Kanami: This might be too technical, but I usually use a Triple Rectifier from Mesa/Boogie, and if the spec is even slightly different from what I use, I can’t use my pedal board and my system. This time I didn’t have such a problem and I played stress-free, which was really nice.

Kobato: In my case, I used to bring only one guitar before but this time I brought two guitars, which made a big difference, I think, po. We were able to play in environments similar to what we have in Japan, and I think it was well reflected in our sound, po.

- Cheering is becoming allowed with some limitations in Japan too. How was the situation at the venues in the US?

Kobato: The US had no limitations at all, so we heard a lot of cheers at Aftershock. I felt their voices were even louder than three years ago, po. There were almost twice as many people, of course, and each venue was fully packed with our masters and princesses, but each of their voices was more passionate than three years ago, po.

Saiki: They clearly showed their excitement, and when I said “Come on, louder!” the volume of their voices more than doubled. So I was like “This is awesome!” I really felt the strength, or power, of their voices. As we went on doing servings, my body got more fatigued but my heart got more powerful, or encouraged.

- We would like to ask each of you what was memorable for you. Misa-san, you said you were looking forward to drinking over there.

Misa: I was able to drink many different local beers at each venue.

Kobato: There were many different tastes, po, right?

Misa

- I know that you practiced, or readapted yourself to, drinking beforehand (laughs).

Kobato: You were able to drink a lot thanks to that, po!

Misa: Yeah. Speaking of drinking, actually I didn’t feel well on the day we left for Japan. After the final serving was over, I didn’t go to bed and drank all night until the morning.

Kobato: You would naturally feel sick in that case, po.

Misa: I wanted to sleep well on the flight to deal with the time difference, so I drank wine and the like, which I usually don’t drink. And I felt sick because of that, but other than that, I didn’t have a hangover at all.

Saiki: I was surprised like “Have you drunk that much?!” on the last day (laughs).

- You celebrated your birthday over there, didn’t you?

Misa: Yes! That was really nice. My birthday was October 15, and they celebrated it also on October 14 like my birthday eve. The venue was big and wonderful, so I made a great memory.

Kobato: When we surprised her with a letter and a cake at the rehearsal, she cried, po.

- What was written on the letter?

Misa: It had messages from all of them, including our staff. I was so happy because it was the first message card for a really long time, and I even can’t remember how long.

Akane: When we members went shopping together, we secretly bought the birthday card for her birthday, like “Let’s surprise her with this”. It had a weird drawing of a middle-aged man!

Kanami: Not a middle-aged man but a grandpa!

Kobato: There was a birthday card saying something like “Grandpa, I wish you a long life”, and it was the last one in stock. Misa really loves such surreal humor, so we decided to go with it, po (laughs).

- Akane-san, how about you?

Akane: I had made a setlist with candidate songs for myself and practiced those songs, but a lot of songs that weren’t candidates came into the setlists depending on venues. My bandmates practiced well in the bus, but you can’t play the drums there. So I was anxious and I sometimes let myself go into the venue earlier for rehearsal, but I was surprised myself I was actually able to play them live. In the past, it would be so hard that I would have said honestly “Sorry, I can’t play them”, so this time I gained confidence, which meant the most to me.

Akane

Saiki: You were awesome. I was like “Oh, you can do it” (laughs).

Misa: You did a great job. Like, you rewrote the scores.

Akane: I couldn’t practice, so the only way to practice was to organize it in my head. I managed to do it, which gave me a lot of confidence.

Kanami: You also went to buy a snare, right?

Akane: The snare I had been using didn’t sound great after arriving the US, so I bought a snare in LA in a hurry. I used the new snare throughout the tour after that.

- So all of you feel your playing has improved even more. Kobato-san, how about you?

Kobato: I celebrated my birthday on the tour just like Misa did. That was October 21, and the following day was like a closing party, po. I saw how Misa’s birthday went and I was like “The surprise was awesome, po!” so I got into the venue while thinking “I’ll be sad if there’s nothing for me, po, I believe there will be, po” then I found a cake that looked exactly like my signature Zemaitis guitar. It was actually as big as the guitar and the patterns were drawn in great detail. I was like “What on earth is this, po?!” I was so happy and so surprised, po. Also, in the Shibuya Public Hall DVD we released a while ago, there was a scene where I got the audience excited like “Say!”, which was made into a GIF and became popular, po. I didn’t know it had spread overseas, but during my MC time, some masters and princesses here and there suddenly held up towels with a drawing in the realistic style that’s printed in the wood printing style (laughs). They celebrated but teased me (laughs).

Masters and princesses holding up towels printed with Kobato

Saiki: That was so Kobato, right? (laughs)

Kobato: Like, I was happy but I couldn’t be simply happy, po (laughs). If teasing goes that far, I’m rather happy, though, po.

Kanami: In the part where she said “Moe moe, say!”, they were like “Say!” (laughs).

Kobato: I was like “No, po! That’s not it, po!” (laughs) That was so funny, po.

Miku Kobato

- They love you.

Kobato: I better hope so, po (laughs). This time we had an interpreter with us, and she taught me English for my MC, so I was able to do my MC in English at each location and had fun interactions with people there, po. That’s exactly because cheering was allowed. At in-person servings where cheering wasn’t allowed, we asked them to use towels, but this time I was cheered for the first time in a while and I got so excited in the call and response that my movement got more and more exaggerated. That was so much fun, po.

- Saiki-san, how about you?

Saiki: We had been preparing for the US tour since we were in Japan, and we thought we would have to change setlists later, or rather, we all wanted to change them later. We were going to do that number of shows for the first time, and we had a lot of destinations, so I was pretty thrilled at what kind of reaction they were going to show. At the first stop of Seattle, I’d forgotten about that and went right into the serving (laughs). Thankfully they were so excited, but we forgot to prepare the MC time in English, so it was the only show almost without any English (laughs).

Kobato: We were like “Oh, this is not Japan”.

Saiki: We worked hard to increase English from the next stop of San Francisco. As for songs, our standard songs that get them excited at each venue were no different than in Japan, but we were thinking about each show throughout a month, so I think we gained some ability of precognition. Also, we’ve been writing more and more songs with call and response and songs you can sing along, which worked really nice.

Kobato: They sang along a lot, po, right?

Saiki: Yeah. That was the moment I felt their excitement most. I’m repeating myself but the awesome power of their voices pushed me forward, and even though I had thought my throat would never last, it was actually pretty fine.

Saiki

Kobato: We had prepared a lot more instrumental songs in case Saiki might not be able to sing, and we were like “We’ll handle it when your throat can’t hold up, po”. Actually, far from needing backup songs, we often decided to play older songs that require her voice more, so we were kind of more surprised!

Saiki: I don’t mean I had a high opinion of myself, though. I used to sing thinking my throat will be OK, but on this tour, I learned to save it. Now I try not to sing for so long in rehearsal, in order to save my throat for the show. I didn’t like that before, but I feel safe now because our instrumentalists have got higher skills. Three years ago, the five of us used to work hard in a pretty strict atmosphere, but that feeling was gone, and I felt like “It’ll be all right because we’re together”, which meant a lot.

Kobato: It helped us a lot that our masters and princesses sang along a lot, po, right?

Akane: They are all good at Japanese.

Kobato: Actually they sing along in Japanese more than in Japan, po (laughs).

Saiki: People in front of me changed at each show, but I clearly saw their mouths sing in Japanese, so I was like “What?! Are they singing along?!”

Kobato: Some people made me think “They really sing all the songs in full, po!”

Kanami: Some of them remembered all the lyrics, right?

- Kanami-san, how about you?

Kanami: Tony Visconti-san, who produced The Dragon Cries for us, came to the New York show. He brought us his super-expensive 12-string Zemaitis guitar.

Kobato: He brought us one of the only two guitars in the world from the ’70s, po. We had a dinner with him the evening before, and I told him I use Zemaitis guitars there, then he said he would set it up and bring it next day, and he really brought it to us, po.

Kanami

Kanami: We had the pleasure of seeing it. It was my first time playing a 12-string guitar, and it was so difficult to play but it was so much fun. I’d like to play it more, so I’m thinking of having Kobato make a 12-string signature Zemaitis guitar.

Kobato: You don’t do it yourself, po?! (laughs) Tony-san was like “It would suit if you Band-Maid had one, so I will tell the company!”, which is the only possibility (laughs).

Kanami: For his sudden visit, we played The Dragon Cries. We played it for the first time in a while, but it would have been impossible three years ago. Personally, it was my best memory that we played The Dragon Cries and matched our groove well even without preparation.

- So, overall, the tour made all of you realize that your potential has increased.

Kobato: I think our inner strength was also a big factor, po.

Saiki: We practiced hard almost every day in the COVID pandemic but we were wondering if we were really getting better. We’ve done several online okyu-ji but the sound feels different because it goes through the internet, so to speak. It was nice we really felt our growth.

Kanami: I just came across an overseas fancam from three years ago. I watched it because it’s one of the songs we played on this tour, but the sound was totally different than now. The drum’s attack, the sound of picking, and the volume or stability of the vocals were all different.

Saiki: We were different in every way (laughs). Like “Are they a copy band of us?” (laughs)

Kobato: I really feel so, po! (laughs)

Kanami: I felt safe and relieved as I realized that our inner strength and skills had improved in the last three years.

Saiki: This sense of security is partly because of our growth, but also because the environment was really good.

Kobato: Three years ago, the live sound engineer was an American, and we sometimes had a difficulty in communication even for turning up or down. Equipment too. As I said at the beginning, I think the fact that we spent so much time on the tour bus led to the sense of security or the stability of servings, po.

- So you moved one step closer to your goal of world domination through the US tour.

Kobato: I think the tour made us grow so much, po.

Band-Maid

- You will be performing at Tokyo Garden Theater in Japan at the beginning of next year. What kind of serving do you want to make?

Kobato: It will be by far the biggest venue in Japan we Band-Maid have played alone, so it will be a new serving in that sense, and I’d like them to see how we have grown through the US tour and what we are now, po.

Saiki: I’d like to make a perfect serving to kick off the year of our 10th anniversary, and I simply want to celebrate the fact that we’ve been around for 10 years with them. I’d like to showcase our growth in various ways. Like, you’ll be surprised if you underestimate us (laughs).

Kobato: There are so many people who got to know about us in the last three years, like through live streaming. I think a lot of people will come to see us for the first time in January next year, so I’m feeling like surprising them, po.

Kanami: I will do my best!

Saiki: There were a lot of people who were surprised at us in the US, and I saw that with my own eyes. I also felt their gaze like “Oh, you can play this good!” I was like “Yeah, this is it”. Our contrast is what makes us different, so I’d like us to go beyond their expectations also in our contrast.

Misa: I’d like to simply have fun playing as usual.

Kobato: While drinking (laughs).

Akane: I don’t know what kind of serving it will be myself, but I’m glad we are confident in presenting ourselves after going on the US tour and experiencing the big venue of Saitama Super Arena (note: they played as a supporting act for the Guns N’ Roses concert in Japan the other day), so I’m looking forward to it myself, and I hope they are all looking forward to it too.

Kanami: I have more songs to write through our experience in the US.

Kobato: About our feelings in the US (laughs).

Kanami: Yes, exactly!

Kobato: She says so, po! So don’t miss it, po!

“This band is my life’s purpose, because it’s now a part of me, so I am pouring all my energy into BAND-MAID” - Kanami


- First off, Kanami, please tell us about your childhood.


Kanami: I am the youngest child, with an older brother and sister. I took a lot of lessons in my childhood. Classical ballet, piano, calligraphy, abacus, English...and things like that. I think that my parents wanted me to try various things to find out what I liked. The only thing that I stuck with was the piano. I was a quiet child. However, I was quite active in elementary school. I would borrow my brother’s BB gun and go play airsoft (laughs). But, since that time, people often say that I am an airhead. (NOTE: We’ve all heard the other members call her this. It has less negative connotations in Japanese, and is seen as more cute and innocent) (EXTRA EDIT: Please see here for another explaination to this word here, as noted by t-shinji here.


- From piano to airsoft, that’s quite the range (laughs). Did you have anything you were especially good at?


Kanami: What I was especially good at… Obviously music, right? I was, without a doubt, not good at P.E. (laughs). I also liked Japanese class, Classical Japanese texts, English, and other subjects in the Humanities.


- Since you’ve like music since you were a child, does it mean that you also discovered rock music early on?


Kanami: No, I didn’t. I learned about rock music when I was in senior high school and joined the light music club. Because I played the piano, I started on the keyboard when I first joined, but mid way through, I started the guitar. I had wanted to play the guitar because… what was it. Was it due to my senior classmates… it was cool and charming…? Ah, I remember! I wanted to be popular with girls.


- Ehhh, with girls and not boys?


Kanami: Yes. I wanted the other girls to think that I was cool (laughs). Then, just as I had hoped, I heard them say, ‘Isn’t Kanami so cool when she’s playing the guitar?’ That felt good, so I kept playing the guitar.


- I am not sure if that’s a good or bad reason (laughs). So, when you started playing the guitar, did you have any guitarists that you liked?


Kanami: Due to my reason for starting (laughs), I didn’t have a particular guitarist that I liked. At first, when I started playing guitar, I wasn’t playing it in a band, just practicing the basics by myself. Then the 3rd year senior who taught me guitar asked, “Well, why don’t we play together in a band?” and invited me to play in their band. So then, I got together with other classmates and formed a band. My seniors gave me songs to try, and the first one was However by Glay, and after that KISS, Deep Purple, and Metallica… I covered a variety of Western hard rock music. From then on, it was getting more and more fun to play the guitar, and I wanted to be able to play these songs. I also covered Judy and Mary, Kaela Kimura, Chatmonchy. After that, I formed a band myself and did the guitar and vocals.


- That’s segues into your later time as a singer/songwriter. When did you start composing?


Kanami: It started in senior high school. Then, I was writing about three songs a year, and now when I think about it, that’s a slow pace (laughs). I wonder if the pace picked up a bit in university… I decided to work as a singer/songwriter in university, but the style of the songs were much better than the songs I wrote in my high school band. At that time, I had liked mellow songs, so I was making songs focused on emotional subjects.


- When you were working as a singer/songwriter, did you sing while playing the acoustic guitar?


Kanami: Yeah, for the most part, but when I wanted to play as a band, I asked for some help. I rearranged the songs for a band and I would sing, play the electric guitar, and solos. At that time, I had gone to a lot of auditions, and I auditioned in the form of a band.


- While playing in those two styles, was there a reason you thought performing solo was better than performing in a band?


Kanami: Bands are more difficult because all the members need to have the same level of motivation and have similar directions that they want to take the music. So, I chose to work alone. I thought that I would compose and arrange the songs myself, so I also studied DTM (NOTE: this is a Japanese word that is in English, desktop music, which is used to mean digital musical composition). However… I didn’t like the act of singing that much.


- Really? That means you went to voice training not because you liked singing, but because if you had to sing, you wanted to do it properly...and?


Kanami: That’s right. At any rate, I thought that it wasn’t good to have low singing ability. At that time, I wanted to at least become a professional musician. I had gone to a regular university because my parents wanted me to go. I really wanted to enroll at a vocational school like Akane and Misa, with the intention of becoming a professional musician. So, I asked my parents, “When I finish university, please allow me to pursue my own interests.” I guess, perhaps, my parents were seeing if the 4 years of university would lead me to give up the music path. So conversely, I thought that I had to do extra well to show that I was serious. I studied economics and management at university, so I was able to learn how to market and promote myself as a singer/songwriter. After that, I had to go to voice training to strengthen my singing skills, build a soundproof room in my home, and… other various training methods.


- I think that you worked really hard. During this time, is where the story of Band-Maid begins.


Kanami: At that time, I was uploading my songs and cover videos on YouTube and NicoNico. Kobato, who happened to see them, contacted me through the talent agency. So, when I went to listen to her pitch she asked, “Would you like to be in this kind of band?” I immediately replied that I would. I’ve always wanted to play the lead guitar, and not have to sing (laughs). The concept of the band was interesting, and the songs I heard were cool. So, I had no reason to refuse (laughs). Certainly at that time, I was asked, “Is there no problem with the maid outfits?” When in fact, I had worn a maid outfit in my first band in senior high school when we performed at the school culture festival (laughs) (NOTE: these are yearly events put on by students to display their artwork and to perform plays and music at their schools). That band continued to perform live in maid outfits, so I said, “It’s completely okay!” (laughs). So, after I had decided to join Band-Maid, I left the office and called A-chan. “So, this is the deal. Do you want to do it together?” She said, “Let me think about it for a bit.” (laughs)


- It feels a bit like fate, that you were wearing maid outfits and performing in senior high school. At the beginning of Band-Maid, most of your songs were provided to you, but afterwards you began to write them yourself.


Kanami: While we were receiving songs from other songwriters, I was also writing songs. I submitted them too, but as expected, it was not approved after it was compared to the work of the songwriters. There were a lot of rejections during that time, but I did my best to write more songs through encouragement from Sai-chan. She would not remember, because she was drunk, but she said to me. “Kanami, don’t give up, it is better to keep writing more and more, because you have the talent.” When I heard those words, I thought, “If there are people close to me who accept my music, I must do my best.” I wonder if Sai-chan remembers that…She pretends that she doesn’t remember, but in fact… As usual, she seems not to remember (laughs).


- Well, how about that (laughs). But, you had wanted to write your own Band-Maid songs even before receiving those words of encouragement from Saiki.


Kanami: Yes, I had. I think that because I had been writing songs since senior high school, my desire to put out our own songs was the strongest among the members. Additionally, I had learned a lot by playing the songs provided to us by the songwriters.


- It is impressive that Band-Maid’s songs have both intensity and sophistication, utilizing Kanami’s unique melodies and arrangements.


Kanami: Thank you very much. Originally, I really liked fashionable songs, so I wanted them to be sophisticated, even if they were intense. (NOTE: she literally says オシャレな曲, fashionable or trendy songs. My Japanese friend described it as the kind of music you’d hear at an upscale cafe). So, I obsessed over the chords and of course the melodies too. The hard rock and metal of the past were mainly power cords. That’s fine, of course, but I just wanted to make use of more precision chords and triads. I think that's the type of hard rock in me, and that it’s important to blast out Band-Maid’s unique style.


- Combining a hard sound with sophistication is much easier said than done, but you are doing it very well. Among the songs you’ve made, what was the best, what was a turning point for you as a guitarist?


Kanami: From around the time of “Thrill” (released August 2014 in the single ‘Love, Passion, and Matador), I felt more conscious as a lead guitarist. I had decided that I wanted to stand out more. Before that time, I was often assigned to play the backing phrases, and I often chose to as well. But, thanks to ‘Thrill’, I came to decide that I wanted to play more main phrases and lead guitar.


- But, by taking on lead guitar, the load you have to bear increases a lot, eh.


Kanami: Oh, really?


- Hard rock lead guitar requires technique and are difficult to play. On top of that, the overwhelming demand for guitar solos … and so on, right?


Kanami: Umm… if you say so. But, I wanted to do it. Isn’t it cool to be the person that stands out? (laughs). Band-Maid has many songs with a guitar solo because I think that solos are the most important point, and I want to play solos that have a good sound.


- You sure have come to enjoy playing the guitar. Kanami, the intense performances of your live shows are fascinating. Are you consciously focusing on this?


Kanami: Doing it consciously… hmm, no. More precisely, I feel that it has always been that way. At Band-Maid’s first live serving, I firmly stated that I was a guitarist who loves performing and was already thinking of performing that way. It feels like it’s been this way ever since. I think that, from the beginning, I’ve liked to enchant with the ‘gap’ between our image and performance.


- Certainly, there is a gap. If you have never seen Kanami perform live before, you wouldn’t be able to imagine her usual gentle self performing like that.


Kanami: I am often told that. At the end of the servings, when I thank the masters and princesses, they say “Hey, aren’t you supposed to be a bossy type?” (laughs)


- I understand that feeling because I wanted to say that too (laughs). However, I think there are many who want to give an interesting and intense performance, but can’t. Did it come naturally?


Kanami: Yes, it did. I’ve never rehearsed my movements when I am performing.


- Ah, so you are a natural. Perhaps, even S-rank! (NOTE: Comes from character power rankings, it is the top tier)


Kanami: I think I am S temperament (laughs) (NOTE: the ‘S’ comes from the English word sadistic, but in Japanese it’s simply meant to convey that someone is a doer, who takes the initiative). However, because I have to respond to Sai-chan’s criticisms, I think I am an M temperament in that regard (NOTE: likewise, ‘M’ comes from masochist, but just means someone who is more passive in temperment). The other members often say that I have multiple personalities. They say that I am sometimes ditzy, sometimes serious, and sometimes I act like a gyaru. (NOTE: gyaru comes from the English word ‘gal’ and refers specifically to a fashion style / subculture. Gyaru sport dark tans, bleach blond hair, and are known for being lackadaisical. Perhaps a western proxy is the Valley Girl?)


- Like a gyaru?!


Kanami: Kind of. I sometimes talk like a gyaru and say words like “janaa…(laughs).” (NOTE: Hard to translate that… but it’s a gyaru speech pattern, po!). But, that’s not all. When I am in a bossy mood I talk like that a lot. Well, okay, maybe when I am drinking too (laughs). I am told that I have various sides to me.


- In working as Band-Maid’s composer, arranger, and guitarist, you’ve shown various sides too. What role do you find yourself playing within the band?


Kanami: Hmm, what is it...Honestly? It’s the serious stuff and keeping schedules. I am the kind of person who proceeds with a scheduled plan, so I make long term goals and short term goals, even in daily life. This is true for the band’s activities too, I often discuss long term goals with Sai-chan. As for short term goals, for example, I have a monthly schedule of goals, such as ‘have this completed by this date’ or ‘arrange this song by this date’ or ‘I will do this in that rehearsal.’ I will communicate such and such to the members. I’ve been doing this thoroughly for several years.


- It’s really helpful to have someone like that in a band, eh? Could you talk about your aims and goals as a musician and a guitarist?


Kanami: Right now, I am giving my all to Band-Maid, but thinking about the long term, I would like to write songs for other artists when things are more stable. I would like to try playing the guitar in support of other artists. I want to stand up on the stage, I want to write songs, and I want to play for Band-Maid. But all that I just mentioned, hinges on Band-Maid. This band is my life’s purpose, because it’s now a part of me, so I am pouring all my energy into BAND-MAID.

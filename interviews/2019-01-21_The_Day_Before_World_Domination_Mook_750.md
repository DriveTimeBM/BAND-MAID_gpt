---

- When you were young, what sort of family environment did you grow up in?

Kobato: It was kind of complicated-po. My parents were a remarried couple. I have a half-brother from my mother's previous marriage who is 11 years my senior.

Despite the large age gap, our relationship was one of frequent quarreling and fighting <laughter>. However, that's how I learnt the art of quarreling and fighting. For example, how to throw a punch <laughter>.

- An older brother… (laughter). So were you a very active child?

Kobato: Yes-po. In elementary school, I was always always playing "chanbara" [imitation swordfighting] with the boys, or hunting for cicadas and stag beetles in the summer. I loved racing with other kids. My mum often said "It was very troublesome how every time you saw large, wide-open spaces, you would immediately start running all around"-po. I also ran out of the house very often <laughter>. This sneaking out of the house to play resulted in things such as me falling down the stairs of the apartment building and returning home with bumps and bruises… <laughter>. My hair was also always cut short, so both my looks and character were like that of a boy-po.

- That's quite surprising, given how feminine you look now. Does that also mean you were good at subjects such as P.E. in school?

Kobato: I liked P.E. and Music-po. I liked music because of my grandmother's influence. She went to a Japanese "Enka" [style of Japanese music popular with older folks] Karaoke class [like a social activity club?] and often went to sing/perform at local public hall gatherings-po. From 2nd Year in Elementary School [2nd grade], I started following her to the "Enka" karaoke class. The first song I learnt was TENDO Yoshimi-san's [famous Enka singner] "Chindo Monogatari" <laughter>. From that point, I fell in love with music and singing. But, obviously there were no other children around me that sang "Enka". My mum, who watched me sing nothing but "Enka" got rather worried and told me "Go and listen to more "Morning Musume!"-po <laughter>. Because of that, I started listening to and liking Morning Musume [Pop idol group] and Matsuura Aya [Popular pop idol singer]. After that, I started listening to artistes like Every little Thing and Utada Hikaru. The genres of music that I listened to slowly expanded.

- So you have been familiar with music since you were a child. When did you get into the genre of Rock Music?

Kobato: When I was in Senior High School, there were kids around me who started forming their own amatuer bands, and a friend became a fanatic follower of certain popular bands. This friend invited me to a live band performance, and that was how I got to know about "Bands"-po.

- What sort of live band performance was it that you were invited to back then?

Kobato: It wasn't a famous band. It was a "copy-band" who planned their live show by themselves. It wasn't a professional concert, but a really small-scale, amateur one. That's how I  was initiated into the world of bands-po <laughter>. I'm quite sure the band covered songs by ELLEGARDEN and some others. Although I was introduced to the concept of bands, the music was quite different to that I had been listening to up until then, so I was not interested to the point where "I want to form a band". But I felt that "Bands are interesting…" and started looking into bands. In that process, I came across Tokyo Jihen [Rock band formed by former solo singer Sheena Ringo] and was blown away with the thought "Wow, there is such cool music!"

- So, after your encounter with Tokyo Jihen, you started being involved in bands?

Kobato: No. There were various issues back then and I did not get involved in bands at the time-po. Actually, back when I was in Junior High School, my parents got divorced… my father flew off and disappeared somewhere <laughter>. Because he was a parent-pigeon, so "flap flap…" [sound of flapping wings] <laughter>.

- Eh… Ehhh!?

Kobato: So, I started living with my mother, grandfather, grandmother and brother while mentioning "Father's flown away somewhere huh…"-po <Laughter>. Anyway, life got a lot harder compared to before, right? So, I had to study hard and enroll at a proper public high school. I got into bands and their music while in such a situation, so there was no point at which I could pursue it even though the thought of "I want to pursue music seriously" started to sprout within me. However, unknown to my mother, I had started going to auditions even outside Kumamoto prefecture-po. In fact, I managed to get to the final round of auditions a few times. So, with the savings I had accumulated from part-time work, I even traveled to Tokyo for auditions. Over time, I slowly became unable to control myself-po.

- I understand. If you kept failing auditions, you might have given up…

Kobato: That's right-po. Through the auditions, my feelings of "I definitely want to go to Tokyo" kept growing stronger and stronger. So I took on multiple part-time jobs to save enough money to move to Tokyo. On my birthday, I talked to my mother, "Thank you for letting me go all the way up to University, but I want to go to Tokyo". The paperwork for my withdrawal from University was complete except for affixing my personal seal [Japanese equivalent of a personal signature], and I carried on telling her where I would be living when I reached Tokyo, what sort of part-time work I would be doing while attending voice training, etc… This was my "presentation" to my mother. Well… of course, to have made my mother cry on the occasion of my own birthday… <bitter smile>.

- I think it must have been quite shocking (to your mother) to have made all this preparation in secret. Even then, you were determined to move to Tokyo, right?

Kobato: Even right now, as was back then, I am the type who acts immediately once I decide I want to do something. Also, once I start on something, there is no stopping-po. Once I arrived in Tokyo, I started voice training lessons while doing part-time jobs just as I had told my mother in my "presentation". My part-time job was at a Maid Café where we had to sing and perform individually to customers, so it was also a good opportunity to practice singing-po. Also, since I was also working part-time at a Maid Café back when I was still in Kumamoto, I thought I should experience doing it in Akihabara, the Mecca of Maid Cafes in Japan, since I was in Tokyo <laughter>.

- While having the determination of pursuing music seriously, you still did not think about starting or being in a band, at that point in time, right? So, how was BAND-MAID formed?

Kobato: With the determination to pursue music seriously, I tried all sorts of experiences and got to know more and more people. Through these connections, I received an offer to participate in the formation of an "underground idol" [idol groups that do not have mainstream exposure] group-po. With that, I was active as an underground idol for about 1 year <laughter>. But, while singing cute idol-type songs, I felt "No… this is not it"-po <laughter>. I didn't hate it, but it was more like I realized that "this is different from the music that I aspire to do". So I quit being an underground idol after 1 year of activity and sent my resume to our current management with a request to do the type of music that I wanted to do. I received a reply of "let's meet up once to have a discussion". During the actual discussion, we talked about what I had done up until then, and I was asked "Are you interested in bands, or something similar?"-po. I replied "Well, I like bands, and I am admire Tokyo Jihen. Also, I prefer to do cool music rather than cute music. But, I also like maids." Then, they said "Combining a band and maids would be interesting." And I said "So, let's mix them together" <laughter>.

- The eventual result of what you sought was BAND-MAID, right? How did you find the members?

Kobato: Initially, I was supposed to be the lead vocal and I started looking for other members to fill out the band. The first member I found was Kanami through discovering performance videos she had uploaded to YouTube. I contacted her through the management agency. Akane and then Misa joined after Kanami was recruited and completed the line-up quite smoothly-po. At that time, the agency had already prepared some songsand we started rehearsing immediately to prepare for a performance, but it just felt like there was something missing or not quite right. The idea of "Wouldn't it be interesting if we had another vocalist with a voice contrasting with Kobato's?" came up-po, and I personally thought that the band would shine more with twin-vocals-po. So, we contacted almost everyone managed by the agency to hold auditions. Finally, Saiki was recruited.

- It seems like a destined encounter. But, you did not play the guitar at that point in time, right?

Kobato: Yes. I could not play the guitar at all. Initially, as a band vocalist, all I did was to stand on stage to sing, and we tried doing it with both of us standing on stage to sing when Saiki joined. But the idea of having one of the vocalists holding a guitar on stage would improve the balance of the band came up in discussions. We tried it with Saiki… and it just didn't look right at all <laughter>. So I volunteered "Well then, Kobato will hold the guitar-po!"

- At a first look, the position of "2nd Vocals & 2nd Guitar" seems like a rather easy job. But, to be able to harmonize with Saiki's voice and at the same time play the phrases written by your guitar master and band composer Kanami, must be really tough, right?

Kobato: In hindsight, I probably didn't think so far ahead when I volunteered "Kobato will hold the guitar!"-po <laughter>. Also, in the beginning, I didn't have to actually play properly. However, in the process of seeking our band's characteristic sound, our sound slowly moved in a heavier and harder direction as it is now. It became absolutely necessary for Kobato to play the guitar properly <laughter>.

- The fact that you have improved your guitar skills in accordance to the band's evolution is already an amazing feat on its own. In addition, you also write the lyrics for BAND-MAID.

Kobato: At the very beginning, we were given songs by the management to perform, but between the members, talked about wanting to progress to the level where we would be able to write our own songs-po. Thereafter, Kanami, who was formerly a singer-songwriter, became our primary songwriter. For the lyrics, we tried having everyone write it together. First, Kobato, Saiki and Kanami tried writing the lyrics to a few songs, but Kanami's lyrics were a bit too… strange and airy-fairy…? I mean, for example to the theme of "The dog died…", there were illustrations of a grave on the paper where the lyrics were written, for some reason-po <laughter>. At that point, "Oh dear the dog has died. It's such a sad story, right? But… this doesn't really fit the direction of BAND-MAID… right?" <laughter>. On the other hand, Saiki said "I do want to write lyrics but I can't put it into words". At this point, the lyrics Kobato had written seemed to be a middle-ground between the 2 of them and so it was decided that Kobato would write the lyrics-po.

- What important things do you keep in mind when writing lyrics?

Kobato: When I have to write lyrics, I first listen to the song and take note of the imagery that comes to mind. I will then seek out materials which fit the imagery. I would watch movies, or read novels. For example, if I search for something not too specific like "movies that make you cry" on the internet, all sorts of results appear, right? I will watch the movies that appear on the search results and get inspiration to write lyrics. This type of process happens often-po. Taking a scene from a movie and sublimating myself in it to come up with the lyrics also happens. There are hard times, but it is also fun to do these activities and to think of all sorts of means (to come up with lyrics)-po.

- I've realized during the process of this interview, but whether its about playing the guitar, singing or writing lyrics, you are enjoying it and not thinking of all this as your duty to the band, right?

Kobato: Most probably, I'm the type that will stop wanting to do it if I think about something as a duty-po <laughter>. When I was in the 1st year of elementary school, I went to an organ class. I started going to the class because I wanted to do it on my own accord, but once I started being told "You must do this! You must do that!", I didn't enjoy it anymore and stopped attending the class <laughter>. However, after I stopped attending the class, I practiced on my own by using the learning materials and enjoyed it a lot. It is the same with BAND-MAID. I enjoy it because I want to do it on my own accord-po.

- That is the reason why, even at times when you step back into a minor position, you still shine as brightly as the other members, right?

Kobato: Th… that's embarrassing-po <laughter>. Because, there is really nothing (about me) to be complimented about. Of course, there are many hardships, but to Kobato, BAND-MAID is the first ever band (that I) assembled, so I don't actually know what a band should normally be like. Therefore, within BAND-MAID, I just do what I should to the very hardest and very best of my ability-po.

- I'm sure that the other members and staff of BAND-MAID are really thankful to such a Kobato-san. Well then, what would be the turning points (for you) in terms of songs and specific occasions since BAND-MAID became active?

Kobato: I think the point where I started using a Zemaitis guitar was momentous-po. Within me, what it meant to hold a guitar changed at that point. I thought that Zemaitis guitars are… how can I put it… guitars that only proper guitarists should hold and not something the current (back then) Kobato is worthy of. Therefore, I once again thought that I had no choice but to do more as a proper guitarist-po.

- Sounds just like something the stoic Kobato-san would do. Well then, what role do you think you are responsible for within the band?

Kobato: Hmm… what role is it…? The one who is toyed with? <laughter> There have been occasions where I got angry at the other members for playing around with me, but even after stopping one instance, I would be messed with again-po <laughter>. Also, I am also often told that I am like a man. Comparatively, I am not particular about things, and I tend not to do things together with other people. I'm the type who will go ahead to do things that I want to do, so for example, even if discussions like "let's go somewhere together during the off day on tour" or "let's go have a mean together" comes up, there are times where "Kobato wants to go to this place, so I'll go alone-po" and I'll be off on my own just like that. I'm not very sure what role I play, but I'm very grateful for the fact that we've assembled the members that can live with and forgive such a Kobato-po.

- I see. So what is the ideal image of a musician that such a Kobato-san aspires to be?

Kobato: For me, there is no "I want to become someone like this person"-po. Kobato wants to remain as "Kobato Miku" to the end. To treasure what makes me who I am, and to become someone whom no other person can imitate or replicate. I want to become such a unique existence, and if this can connect to making BAND-MAID a unique band like no other, then I would be very happy-po.

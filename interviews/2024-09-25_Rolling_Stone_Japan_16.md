Band-Maid, known for blending cute maid outfits with hard-hitting rock, celebrated their 10th anniversary in 2023. They embarked on a world tour, performing in four major overseas festivals, including one of the world's largest, Lollapalooza.

The Japanese girl's rock band capped off their anniversary with a successful headline concert at Yokohama Arena. Moving into their 12th year in 2024, Band-Maid is starting a new chapter with the release of their first full album in three and a half years, Epic Narratives, on September 25. The album includes 14 tracks, featuring a song co-written with Mike Einziger of Incubus and a collaboration with the Mexican three-piece girl band The Warning.

Through the interview, the members delve into the themes of this work and their relationships after over a decade of playing together.

The Band-Maid Philosophy and Their Changing Environment

- Band-Maid has been speaking about "world domination" as a goal since the early days of your career . You mentioned this when we spoke around the time of your major debut in 2016, but how realistic did this goal feel at the time?

KOBATO (Gt, Vo): Back then, we were just starting to go overseas. Now, we’re touring all over the world and performing at many different festivals. Our idea of "world domination" now is completely different from what it was back then. We could not see any reality in the dream at the time of our debut. It was almost like a wish to be reality.

SAIKI (Vo): Back then, we said "world domination" with the hope that saying it would make it a reality. But now, within our 10th year , we’ve been performing in the U.S., a place we’ve never been before. Also, the number of countries we’ve performed in has increased gradually. So "world domination" is now more realistic than before, and now we can confidently say it is a band goal.

In 2023, Band-Maid performed at events such as Lollapalooza Chicago

- There was a sense from early on that you were getting a lot of attention overseas. Do you feel that the overseas recognition has helped to produce more attention in Japan?

KOBATO : I've heard that some people heard of us from the news of our appearance at international festivals like Lollapalooza Chicago. But I felt like there was no big difference in the process of expanding the band name both in Japan and overseas. We worked really hard on our servings (l ive s hows), and the number of fans has gradually increased on both sides.

KANAMI (Gt): At the beginning, the venues in Mexico were bigger than we did in Japan, so we were really surprised.

SAIKI: The venues were much larger than anything we’d played in Japan at the time. Live shows in Japan were more like doing a gig with bigger musicians at a small venue . So, in that sense, I feel the overseas audience played a big role in expanding our audience.

- Every time I interview Band-Maid , I’m struck by how good your teamwork is.

SAIKI: Yes, teamwork is definitely one of our strengths (laughs).

KOBATO : I think we’ve been able to tour all around the world because of our good teamwork.

KANAMI: Actually, It’s not only between the band members, but it's also about our supporting staff. We often talk about how lucky we are to have a great team. This team includes our techs, PA, lighting staff, and more staff for sure.

- Have you had any arguments in the last 10 years together?

KOBATO : I don’t think we’ve had a big argument. We try to talk If there’s something bothering us . We are open to having time to sit and communicate when it's needed.

AKANE (Dr): We speak up early , so problems are solved quickly.

SAIKI: But we don’t talk when someone’s temper is running high. If someone’s angry, we’ll say, "Let’s talk about it later," and then set aside time to address the issue calmly.

KOBATO : I think it’s because we communicate frequently that we’re able to do this.

- Is Misa's alcohol consumption okay? (laughs) You are known for drinking even on stage, right?

MISA (Ba): I don’t drink as much as I used to (laughs). I’ve grown up.

KANAMI: Hasn’t Band-Maid ’s overall alcohol consumption gone down?

KOBATO : I think we all drink less now.

SAIKI: We also go to bed earlier these days.

KOBATO : We’ve grown over the years.

SAIKI: It’s important to pace ourselves so we can keep going.

MISA: Moderate drinking and good health are key (laughs).

- One of Band-Maid ’s strengths is the way you all exchange recording files during the production process. Were there any updates to your workflow when creating this album?

AKANE: I started setting up mics on my drum kit to record live pre-production, and I shared those data files with members. I’ve incorporated it into my practice, too. Being able to record and listen to the actual sound I play is helpful in practice.

SAIKI: That was a big change. In the past, Akane created drum fills or solos with programmed sounds on the computer. So the sound turned out different when we started to play the tracks as a band. But that problem is gone now.

AKANE: With programmed drums, it was hard to capture that human, live feel.

KANAMI: I am really thankful to have Akane ’s live audio data instead of programmed drums.

SAIKI: I went on a microphone- buying spree (laughs) and moved into a new place with a soundproof room. Singing was the biggest noise issue. So, I set up a room where I wouldn’t get noise complaints. Now, I can sing anytime and send my vocals whenever it's necessary (laughs).

KANAMI: Having demo vocals available whenever I need them has been a lifesaver! The quality of the production process has definitely improved.

Rolling Stone Japan vol.28 BACK COVER

- It seems like everyone has become more like an engineer when it comes to the pre-production stage.

KANAMI: Our pre-production process is a little different from other bands. We don’t often get together in a studio to work on songs. Sometimes, I’ll go in with Misa and Akane to watch them track the bass and drums, but most of the pre-production is done through file exchanges on our computers. If we had more time, we would do the pre-production with all of us in one studio.

KOBATO : Band-Maid has always written music while we’re touring , so we do what we can with those constraints.

SAIKI: Our style isn’t really suited to locking everything down in the studio as a group.

KANAMI: But next time, when we’re asked, "Have there been any changes in your production style?" we can say, "Actually…"

KOBATO : "We tried it this time!" (laughs)

SAIKI: I’d love to say, "We finalized this song in the studio!" (laughs)

- That would definitely change the feel of the songs, wouldn’t it?

SAIKI: Yes! It would make them a lot simpler.

KOBATO : We’d probably strip things down a lot. Please ask us again next time (laughs).

- Yes, for sure ! (laughs). Your first studio album in three and a half years is finally out in the world.

KANAMI: It really felt like three and a half years.

- What was the meaning behind the title of this album, Epic Narratives?

SAIKI: These three and a half years felt like a long time for us. Some songs are singles that have already been released . Those singles reflect who we were at each moment in the past, so parts are different from who we are now. Some songs are made before the 10th anniversary, and others are made after the 10th anniversary. Kobato and I talked about wanting to tell the "n arrative" that we created within 12 years throughout the album. We also felt like “n arrative” was the right word to use in the title instead of “story.”

KOBATO : This album is a condensed collection of our history. The word "n arrative" can be seen as having the same meaning as “story” in some sense, but it doesn’t . “Story” is just a story. But ”narrative” ties the storyteller to the story. We see the difference a s meaningful. You could be the storyteller, and we could be the storyteller. The relationship works both ways. When I found the word "n arrative," I told the members about this idea, and they liked it. But they also said we need something more (laughs). We felt something was missing. So, we added "e pic" in front to give it that grand feeling.

SAIKI: We had different opinions on the wording , but we picked “e pic” because we wanted a sense of vastness and freedom. Thankfully, Kobato found the right word. We are declaring our new chapter with this album, so we want to use the word “epic” to show our feeling of just getting started and going to a new future.

- In your 2022 EP Unleash, the first track was an instrumental. This time, you’ve placed the instrumental track "Get to the Top" at the end of the album. I heard you felt that an instrumental track was essential in this album.

SAIKI: I believe instrumental tracks are one of Band-Maid ’s strengths. When we started working on the album, I instinctively felt we needed one. With this being a new chapter, I thought we should create a new instrumental track, and from a performance perspective, I wanted to expand our range even more, so I asked Kanami to compose it.

KANAMI: After we finished all the songs, Saiki told me, "We may still need an instrumental track for the album." When I heard that, I felt it was right.

KOBATO : And there’s a reason it’s the final track, right?

SAIKI: I’m not a fan of having an instrumental as the first track on an album (laughs).

KOBATO : It worked on Unleash because that was an EP (laughs).

SAIKI: The atmosphere of the song was also a major reason. I felt Kanami ’s strong energy on this tra ck. We could still see so much potential for the band . So we decided to place it at the end.

KOBATO : The title reflects our feeling of, "We’re going to keep going higher! Keep rising!" Even though it’s the last song on the album, it represents a new beginning for us. I hope listeners feel that sense of both an ending and a new start.

- In the previous interview, Akane said the instrumental track "From Now On" was the most challenging track she’s ever played. How does this one compare?

AKANE: This one is even harder (laughs).

SAIKI: Lately, you’ve been playing "From Now On" without gasping for breath.

AKANE: Yeah, I can breathe now. Humans are amazing (laughs).

KOBATO: Practice and growth (laughs).

SAIKI: Akane is improving all the time, so her technical ability in drums keeps rising.

AKANE: Not just for drums, but for everyone. We’ve all leveled up, so we can’t dial it down now.

KOBATO : Band-Maid have always pushed ourselves to our limits with each song. It’s part of our growth process. That’s why our music keeps getting harder (laughs).

KANAMI: Before we realized it, we’d made things difficult! We don’t intentionally try to make our songs harder, but Misa , for example, keeps making her bass parts more and more complicated.

MISA: When a cool demo track comes in, I feel like I have to step up, and that’s how it happens (laughs).

KOBATO : Everyone just naturally ends up pushing themselves.
Collaborations with Incubus and The Warning

- This album includes the song "Bestie," which you co-wrote with Mike Einziger of Incubus. What was the production process like with Mike Einziger?

SAIKI: Mikey came to Japan, and we worked together in the studio. He’s such a loving person. He asked us about the history of our band, what kind of music each of us had listened to, what influences shaped us, and how we want Band-Maid to evolve . I remember feeling a bit shy and saying, “I can only say this because it’s Mikey,” as we talked (laughs).

KOBATO : Before coming, he did a lot of research on us, asking questions like, “If I wanted to introduce Band-Maid’s music, which song should I listen to first?” He really considered our music. He said he wanted to collaborate on something that only Band-Maid could create, adding an essence that would help us continue as Band-Maid for a long time. We started with discussions among all of us, and then Kanami and Mikey worked on the production together.

KANAMI: I told him I wanted fresh ideas for riffs. Initially, we talked about creating a one-chorus song, and I made a lot of requests like, "I want as many riff ideas as you can think of, " and "I want something like this," even though I wondered if I was asking for too much (laughs).

SAIKI: We even used examples from Incubus songs as references .

KANAMI: Yeah, I said things like, "I want a track like this Incubus song ‘Drive’ " and Mikey would respond to those requests with ideas. He’d say, "What about this?" and then we’d add bass and drums to that foundation. We recorded vocals together, and while jamming, I suggested adding some sample beats. Akane had also prepared some beat patterns in advance.

AKANE: For faster songs, I’d suggest things like whether we should use an eight-beat pattern or how to adjust the bass drum. I had several drum patterns ready to go.

KANAMI: Then, I’d create riffs to match the beat. In the end, we had about seven versions of the demo, labeled like "Mikey 7" (laughs).

- That’s quite the fancy demo title (laughs).

KANAMI: Mikey said, "Just go with the version that’s easiest for you to arrange," and that’s how "Bestie" came together. I feel like we created something fresh .

- The album also includes “SHOW THEM,” a collaboration with The Warning. How did that come about?

KANAMI: The initial demo was based on the idea of what a song would sound like if Band-Maid and The Warning worked together. But we started thinking and wanted to create something new that neither band had done before. So, we submitted a new demo, and everyone was really excited about it.

KOBATO : We had a listening session, right?

KANAMI: We sent all the data over to The Warning’s team and asked them to send back any adjustments they wanted. After that, I made further arrangements and sent the files back. We did this back-and-forth arrangement two or three times, right?

SAIKI: Yeah, that’s right. The first version included a scream from Dany (The Warning’s vocalist), and it was so cool! We were all like, "Wow, this is awesome!"

- It seems like there was a natural compatibility between your two bands, which made it work so well.

SAIKI: We first met at the Aftershock Festival in the U.S. in 2022, but even when we first saw them, it didn’t feel like we were meeting for the first time. We were like, "Who are these adorable girls?" (laughs).

KOBATO : From the moment we met, we kept talking about doing something together.

SAIKI: I think the biggest reason the collaboration worked is that both bands shared the same feeling of wanting to make a big impact on the world. It just felt right .

KOBATO : Most of our communication was done online , but they came to Japan to record together at the end. We even worked on the lyrics, discussing each line one by one while they were in Japan . Afterward, we shot the music video and served together.

- It sounds like working on the lyrics together must have been quite challenging.

KOBATO : It was incredibly difficult. The cultures we grew up in are so different, for sure. So are the languages.

SAIKI: They’re almost native-level in English, but it’s not their first language .

KOBATO : They’ve grown up in an environment where they use English daily . So, we got some opinions about how we use English words in the lyrics. Something like “this English expression might carry a different nuance in Mexico.” Since neither of us was using our first language, there were times when things didn’t fully come across at first. But we worked through everything, one line by one line.

KANAMI: We had a lot of back-and-forth discussions.

KOBATO : There were times when I’d say, "I really want to use this word here!" And The Warning would suggest, "How about this instead?" It was a constant exchange of ideas.

SAIKI: Actually, The Warning told us they never use phrases like "You can do it," "No more way," "Stand up, take it," or "Stand upright, now go."

KOBATO : But there were some suggestions that included phrases that Band-Maid would never use in songs (laughs).

SAIKI: We explained that we wanted our Japanese listeners to understand the lyrics intuitively as well. Also, I wanted Dany to say, “You can do it!” (laughs).

KOBATO : We had to find a balance, respecting their wishes while asking them to respect ours. It was a give-and-take process where we each made compromises on certain points. For example, I had a strong feeling about the first line of the chorus—I insisted, "It has to start with this line!"

KANAMI: Both sides had things they wouldn’t back down on. It was very much an artistic collaboration.

KOBATO : I had never worked on songwriting this way before, so this process inspired me a lot.

AKANE: There were no compromises, which made it even more rewarding.

- It sounds like working with fresh talent really broadened your scope.

KANAMI: It was an exciting experience.

KOBATO : It was fun, and I feel like we all grew from it.

SAIKI: During that production period, we all became really close. When it was time to say goodbye, everyone was crying (laughs).

AKANE: They were speaking in English, and we were speaking in Japanese. We were like, "It was really fun and the best time." Even though we spoke different languages, somehow, we all understood each other (laughs).

KOBATO : It felt like we were communicating, even though we spoke in Japanese, and they couldn't understand our language (laughs).

- It sounds like the collaboration worked so well because there were no compromises in Band-Maid and The Warning's creative process.

KOBATO : We were both determined not to compromise on what we felt was important, but we also shared the same goal of creating something great. Because of that true belief, we made an amazing, powerful song.

- Finally, what kind of album has Epic Narratives become for Band-Maid ?

SAIKI: Every song means a lot to us. The artwork reflects the album as our n arrative . There is a tower we’ve built named Band-Maid , and many people gather around it, forming a town that keeps growing. The album represents the beginning of a new chapter in our narrative.

KOBATO : There are also elements from our past singles’ artwork, and the sea from the Unleash EP is included, symbolizing how the band and music expand from there.

SAIKI: We’ve declared that this is a new chapter for Band-Maid , and we’ve packed this album with our determination to keep moving forward. This album isn’t about being satisfied with where we are now; it’s full of our drive to challenge ourselves even more.

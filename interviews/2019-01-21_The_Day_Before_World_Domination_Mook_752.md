---

- What kind of family environment were you brought up in and what kind of child were you?

MISA: I was a mischievous child when I was in Kindergarten. But according to my mother, I was a very easy child to bring up. Although, it seems like it was because I was always playing by myself and therefore she could be hands-off with me. When playing with friends, I would do things such as co-riding a tricycle (meant for 1 child) with boys that I liked. I was mischievous, quite a tomboy and was always acting like an adult <laughter>. In addition, although I was a very lively child, it seems I would not do things that were dangerous and could possibly cause serious injuries. I was really a good kid huh... back then.


- "Back then... huh <laughter>." When you were in elementary school, were there any subjects you were good at?

MISA: I liked music and arts and crafts. I liked making crafts or drawing things. I had fairly good results at P.E. as well, but I was bad at... or rather I hated studying <laughter>. I obtained 4s or 5s for music, art and P.E. and 2s or 3s for other subjects [Note: Out of a scoring system of 5, for progress report. Please correct me if I'm wrong]. It was pretty obvious [what I liked and disliked] desu-yo <laughter>.


- Yes, indeed <laughter>. So even after entering elementary school, you were still as mischievous as before?

MISA: Yes, I was still mischievous in elementary school. But after I entered junior high school, that changed. I had been living in Okayama all the while until then, but due to my parents' circumstances, the family moved to Tokyo and I think I became very reserved and obedient. I could not get used to Tokyo. It seemed like people in Tokyo would judge harshly if they heard you speaking dialects from Western Japan, and I also couldn't really fit in well with my peers at the same grade. As a result, I became increasingly introverted desu-yo. Even then, there were a few friends that i clicked with and I enjoyed my time having fun with them. In 1st year of Junior high school [7th grade], I was introverted, then in 2nd year I slowly warmed up to my peers and in 3rd year I was friends with everyone... something like that.


- When did you awaken to music and rock (music)?

MISA: I started learning the piano when I was 4. It was my parents that made me learn the piano at first, but I enjoyed it a lot and hence continued all the way. Then, in 4th year of elementary school, I joined the school's brass ensemble and played the alto horn and continued until I graduated. I intended to join the symphonic band in junior high school but my school didn't have one desu-yo. I thought I still wanted to participate in a club activity and ended up joining the Japanese Tea Ceremony club <laughter>.


- Eh? The Japanese tea ceremony club?

MISA: If I was in the Japanese tea ceremony club, I would be able to eat Japanese sweets while at school, and I also liked Matcha [powdered green tea] <laughter>. But I stopped once I started my 2nd year in Junior high school. I finally realized that the tea ceremony club didn't suit me in my 2nd year <laughter>. Even if I didn't go to club activities, I could still buy my own Japanese sweets to eat <laughter>. So I went through my 2nd year in Junior high school without any club activities. In my 3rd year, the school finally started a symphonic band. I... joined immediately and spent 1 year in the club playing the trumpet.


- In other words, you only awakened to rock (music) after you went to Senior high school?

MISA: I'm not sure if you could call it awakening, but from when I was very young, my mother always listened to music by Jimmy Hendrix, The Beathles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, etc. For Japanese music, it would be artistes like Okuda Tamio and GRAPEVINE. So, from the moment that I started becoming of aware of things around me [toddler age?], I had already touched the rock music genre. Apparently, it seems there was also one time where I was hooked on Johnny's [Male entertainer / idol groups under Johnny & Associates talent agency, eg. SMAP, Arashi, etc.] when I was in elementary school <laughter>.


- "Apparently"... meaning you don't actually remember it?

MISA: That's right desu-yo <laughter>. Apparently I liked TOKIO's Nagase (Tomoya) [TOKIO's main vocalist], and I have been told that I would exclaim "TOKIOoo!" whenever I saw him on TV. Apparently I thought his name was "Tokio" <laughter>. Seeing me behave like this, my rock (music)-loving mother apparently sensed danger [daughter falling into the male idol trap] and schemed to make me like Wada Sho, the Vo&G of rock band TRICERATOPS. She forced me to watch all sorts of live performance videos every single day, such was the wild and brutal method she came up with desu-yo<laughter>. From that, i ended up liking Wada Sho as my mother had planned and I started listening to all sorts of bands <laughter>. In addition, I also ended up liking the band Jellyfish, which my mother also liked, and I set one of their songs as my "new mail receipt" ringtone when I first got a mobile phone.


- So, having gone through such times, did you end up thinking that you wanted to be part of a band as well?

MISA: From the time when I was in Junior high school, I had been thinking "I want to form a band when I get to Senior high school". As if on cue, when I was in my 3rd year of Junior high school, my mother suggested to me "Do you want to play the guitar?", and I was taught how to play the acoustic guitar by one of her friends. I recall things such as steadily practicing how to hold the F chord. Anyway, once I entered Senior high school, I immediately went to buy a guitar. I got a Telecaster, formed a "copy band" with friends and started being active as G&Vo.


- Oh, you started off as Guitar & Vocals. At that time, what bands did you "copy"?

MISA: We covered Kimura Kaela' [Japanese pop-rock singer] songs. But, the band was disbanded in no time at all.


- Why was that?

MISA: It was almost impossible to carry out any activities. Time spent practicing was short, and we did nothing but song covers [copy] and so couldn't really hold proper live performances... so like this, the band couldn't take off at all desu-yo. Anyway, even though the band ended like that, I thought that I wanted to find a way to continue and at that time, a senior 2 years older, who had graduated from high school, invited me to join their band, asking "would you play the bass?" I thought I wanted to try to play the bass as well, and not just the guitar, and hence decided to switch to the bass guitar track. Ever since then, I have been playing the bass.The band which I was invited to join by that senior had been playing original music from the start, and finally settled on a Western-music-ish style desu-yo. The songs were all in English in a grungy style similar to The Smashing Pumpkins.



- When you started playing the bass, were there any bassists that you were influenced by?

MISA: When I listened to The Smashing Pumpkins, I was an admirer of D'arcy (Wretzky). But, after going to music school, and while surfing the internet during my free time, I discovered a summary page of "cool female bassists" and once I opened the page, the first bassist on the list was Paz Lenchantin. She was an American bassist, and while she now plays bass for the Pixies, she is also a member of The Entrance Band. When I watched a video of their live performance, it was love at first sight. She performed just like a male musician would... in any case, she was so cool. She even did things like getting on top of her amp to play <laughter>. On top of that, she could play so many ways on her precision bass, and I really like the sound she produced. Since then, Paz has always been an existence that I admire.


- It was not just the ability to play (the bass), but also that immense presence that attracted you, right?

MISA: Personally, I was never one to be focused on technique and technical stuff. It's the same with D'arcy of The Smashing Pumpkins. I listened to their music because I liked the simple stuff. I only started being mindful of my technique after I joined BAND-MAID. At the root of it all, I only want to be "a cool bassist" desu-yo.



- As a result, MISA-san yourself has become a bassist who combines both the cool factor and great technique. Could you tell us about the time when you were invited to join BAND-MAID?

MISA: After graduating from music school, the band that I was in with my high school seniors was disbanded not long after. Just as it was decided that we would disband, I received a call from Akane desu-yo. I got to know Akane after graduating from music school through work at artistes' gigs. We had also jammed together at live events. Anyway, I received a call from Akane and so I went  "What's up?"... no wait, at that point in time I still called her Akane-SAN <laughter>. "Hi Akane-san, what's the matter?", I asked, and she replied "I was invited to join a rock band where we dress in maid costumes and play music that is totally the opposite to how we look. I am going to do it, so what if Misa joins too?". Because I wanted to first digest and organize the contents of what I had just heard, and even more importantly, because I had answered that phone call while in an Izakaya [Japanese style pub / restaurant] in a state of drunkenness, I answered: "... please give me one night to think it over", and temporarily put the issue on hold <laughter>.


- I see <laughter>. But after thinking through it for a night, you committed yourself to joining the band, right?

MISA: Anyways, I did not want to stop playing the bass. Also, the music demo that was given to me to listen to was proper rock music that was cool desu-yo. With such music, there was no danger of turning into an idol band, and I thought it was quite interesting.


- The current MISA-san's stage costume is actually comparatively light on the maid elements, right?

MISA: In the beginning, it was definitely a maid costume. The skirt was short and our knees were exposed <laughter>. But, as we progressed, the discussion "let's change the costumes a bit to suit each member's style" came up, and "a long skirt will probably suit MISA better"was one of the results. Now, I consider the initial costume as a dark history <laughter>.


- No, no, I don't think it was (a piece of) dark history <laughter>. But, I do think it was a fantastic idea to bring out the members' individual characteristics.

MISA: Yes, I think so too. Initially, I was really embarrassed desu-yo. The moment I first put on the maid costume, I thought "Crap, I've never worn anything like this before" <laughter>. I wore a tiny hat accessory [Yes, THAT tiny hat] and knee-high stockings... I was never one who was comfortable with Cosplay and all that, so i was really at a loss as to what to do <laughter>.


- Out of the 4 members I have spoken to so far, 2 had some reservations with the maid costumes <laughter>. Both stage costumes and music have changed in the course of you getting to where you are now, but were there any songs or moments that were turning points for you as a bassist?

MISA: Actually... there was 1 time when I thought I wanted to quit BAND-MAID. It was before the 1st or 2nd one-man [BAND-MAID only concert, not as part of a bigger event or joint event with other bands or activities]. I felt there was a slight gap between the music that I really liked and the music that BAND-MAID was playing at that point in time. In my own private time, I only listened to music that I personally liked, and so during that period, my feelings of "even though I actually want to play this type of music instead..." turned into a strong desire, I think. In addition, I was doing 2 or 3 part-time jobs while doing work as part of the band, and hence I was both physically and mentally exhausted. As I result, I started thinking "If I form a band that does the type of music that I really like, the situation might be much better". I was quite troubled about this and discussed it with our manager at that time. I was told "For now, why don't you take a good look at the view from the stage at the next (one-man) performance and decide after that?" as a suggestion. So, when it was time and I went up on stage to perform, the view before me was truly amazing. The expressions of the Masters and Princesses and the response and reactions to our music moved me deeply and I enjoyed that "service" [BAND-MAID's live performance] very much. Above all, seeing that view before me made me think "this band can go much, much higher (further)". So, I decided to continue with the band.


- It's not an understatement to call that a huge turning point.

MISA: My consciousness was completely transformed. Completely different from the time before where I was so troubled, I was able to totally enjoy being part of the band. Other than that... well, the fact that I only produced sounds that I personally liked did not change, but I think the point where I was able to play a 5-string bass properly was probably another turning point. In "the non-fiction days" (released in May 2016 as part of the "Brand New Maid" EP), I was only able to go down to a Drop C# with the 4-string bass, and that was the limit. I totally could not produce the lower sounds desu-yo. I had continued recording and performing while having the nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right, but after that, while working on new songs, it became clear that I would not be able to play the new songs without using a 5-string bass. At that time, I fortunately found a G&L 5-string bass and quickly practiced for the 2 weeks prior to recording <laughter>.


- So the saying that if you work hard and work earnestly at things, what you need will come to you at the times where you need it, is true, huh.

MISA: I'm not so sure about that. But, it's true that I do feel that I have very good timing. When I thought I wanted to continue playing the bass, work opportunities like gig support jobs would come; when the band that I was in disbanded, the invitation to join BAND-MAID came; when I needed a 5-string bass, a found a good one, etc.


- What are the important things to you when playing bass for BAND-MAID?

MISA: I think about the bass line while listening to the demo of new songs, but basically, aside from the bridge-chorus [someone more enlightened please help to translate サビ. Japanese songs seem to have some unique structure], I do not want to have the same lines repeated for the 1st and 2nd verses desu-yo. While I play the bridge-chorus similarly the 1st and 2nd time, for every other parts, I want to change everything up. Well... I'm the one who has to memorize it so later on, it is my own self that will have a hard time <laughter>. Also, I often don't hold the bass when I am coming up with the bass lines. I form an image in my head, then use the bass to record it, listen to it, then refine it in my head... I repeat this process over and over until I am satisfied. Recently, I have been using this process a lot. Even if I think the line sounds super cool based on the image in my head, when I actually try  toplay it on the bass, it is often unbelievably difficult, though <laughter>.



- Well then, has MISA-san grasped exactly what sort of role you play within the band?

MISA: I am known for not smiling on stage, right? But, I am actually the one fooling around the most when hanging around with the other members only. I like to make people laugh, and I like to laugh myself, so I often team up with Akane to make the rest laugh. So, my role would be the in-house comedian of the band?<laughter>.


- When I first received this task to interview you, I did some research such as watching your MVs and looking at your photographs and remember thinking "She isn't going to talk to me much, huh". But, now that we are actually doing this, it's completely different.

MISA: I actually laugh properly and often, and I can talk properly as well <laughter>.

But, I get nervous very easily. That's why, during our "services", I drink alcohol... <laughter>.


- You drink alcohol as your stage drink, right <laughter>. I think that the fact that it never impairs your ability to perform on stage is amazing every time I see it happen.

MISA: Although, when I drink too much, I do become useless <laughter>. Before joining BAND-MAID, such as with the previous band, I did often cause quite a bit of problems <laughter>. But, such things have stopped happening recently. I am told very often desu-yo: "It's not actually alcohol in your bottle, right?" I will set the record straight again and say that it IS actual alcohol in those bottles. Even if I am not feeling too well, I may just limit my drinking a bit more, but those bottles I put (on my amp) are the real thing.

- You really do like alcohol, huh <laughter>. Could you tell us what is the image of the ideal bassist that MISA-san aspires to become?

MISA: I want the whole world to recognize that bassist=MISA [when they think of bassist, they will think of MISA]. Even if BAND-MAID ends, I want to continue to be recognized as MISA the bassist. I will work hard towards becoming such a bassist.

“I want to carry on proving the fact that music has nothing to do with gender through my drumming and BAND-MAID's music” - Akane


- So Akane-san, how was life like in your childhood?

Akane: When I was a child, I was very unsociable, and would be constantly scowling at all the children around me... I was that kind of problem child <laughter>. I would also do things like suddenly leaving the Kindergarten to go home without permission, be the only one not participating in any of the group games and activities. The teacher had to be attached to me all the time because I was totally uncooperative and could not get along with the others, a real problem child.


- I... I see (laughter). Are you an only-child?

Akane: No. I have an elder brother. But he is actually the son of my stepfather and is 11 years older. When I entered elementary school, he was already almost an adult, so we hardly spent any time living together. Therefore, while I do have a brother, the environment I grew up in was similar to that if I were an only-child. Having said that, our relationship was good, or rather the whole family was close and we would go shopping together or gossip about our love life, just like friends.


- Almost like an only-child. Perhaps this influenced the unsociable personality you mentioned earlier.

Akane: I think so too. So while I was a real loner in Kindergarten, by the time I was in 2nd or 3rd year of elementary school, I was gradually starting to enjoy talking to other people. The other children around me aren't really enemies, I guess <laughter>. With that, the number of friends increased and life in school become very enjoyable.


- So you were transformed in elementary school. What subjects or activities were you good at in elementary school?

Akane: I liked home economics and art.I would make things for recreation or presentations and prepare decorations for events such as sports day, but I hated studying <laughter>. Also, I liked music. I learnt the piano since I was in kindergarten, so I have always been interested in music. I did try participating activities such as tennis and basketball, but I was no good at all.


- I see. I actually thought you have the image of someone who is good at sports or physical activities.

Akane: My motivation is simply "let's try this". When the anime - "The Prince of Tennis" was popular, I tried tennis; I tried basketball due to the influence of (the manga / anime) "Slam Dunk" <laughter>. I have loved anime since I was young, so I was easily influenced by anime. Because of such flimsy motivation, I don't continue for long. I get interested in all sorts of things and I try doing whatever piques my interest, but I never carry on for long. The only thing that continued my interest in was music. However, I only continued playing the piano until 3rd year of elementary school, and towards the end I did it without enjoying it. From junior high school up until 2nd year of senior high school, I played the trombone for 5 years, but I felt that this wasn't something I wanted to keep doing. But right after that, I started playing the drums and fell in love with it.


- What was the trigger that made you start drumming?

Akane: When in my 2nd year of senior high school, I had so many friends who were into bands and in the process of going to watch live performances with them, I developed a "band boom" within myself. Thereafter, I was totally hooked on bands and started going to (music) festivals and as a result, I quit the symphonic band towards the end of my 2nd year in senior high school and joined the "Kei On" club [basically a band, with guitars and drums and vocals. Watch the anime K-On!]. I started with the guitar, but... I was so unbelievably bad at it I couldn't play at all <laughter>. My hands were really small, so my fingers couldn't reach. So it would be even worse for the bass, right? I couldn't sing either, so I thought, all that's left is the drums and once I tried I got the hang of it immediately and thought "this is it!".


- You went through many musical instruments before your fateful meeting with the drums, I see. When you developed your "band boom", which bands did you like?

Akane: I started listening to music by ORANGE RANGE, ELLEGARDEN and BUMP OF CHICKEN. I was especially hooked on ELLEGARDEN and BUMP OF CHICKEN. When I started drumming, I mainly played the songs of these 2 bands. Except that I was the only member of the "Kei On" club in my year, so I always practiced alone. At the end of 2nd year, you are supposed to stop club activities and focus on preparing for university entrance exams, you see. But I wanted to do a "Graduation Live (performance)" no matter what, so I roped in a friend (or friends?) who had "retired" from the symphonic band and performed as a copy band of PE'Z. Now now that I think about it, that was not an appropriate difficultly level for a beginner <laughter>.


- So you got further hooked on bands after discovering the joys of drums and live music.

Akane: Completely hooked <laughter>. So much so that, I had originally decided to work as a hairdresser after graduation,but in the summer of 3rd year [final year] in senior high school, I suddenly told my form teacher "I want to enroll in a music school". My teacher was strongly against it, but my parents supported me very strongly. So I went to convince my teacher together with my parents, and went to many music schools' open-house every week during the summer holidays. So I studied drums at the Tokyo School of Music for 2 years after graduating from high school. At that time, I teamed up with seniors to form a band, but we disbanded and I couldn't really form another band with anyone. So I found opportunities to do support work in all sorts of gigs including some professional ones. Through these experiences, I decided seriously to pursue music as a career.  So I decided to first do what I was able to on my own, and started working in a music restaurant in Yokohama. Live bands performed there, and I started working there part time as a waitress. After the restaurant closed for the day, I would find opportunities to play the drums in front of the store manager. Like this, I was acknowledged by the manager and was allowed to start playing the drums on stage... but there weren't enough service staff in the hall, so I would continue working as a waitress and then go up on stage to perform when it was time <laughter>.


- It must have been tough, but I guess there wasn't a moment wasted either. Was it during this period that you met Kanami?

Akane: I was acquainted with Kanami back when I was still in music school. The band that I was in did a combined live show with the band that Kanami was in. Kanami was the support guitarist in that band, and I thought "she is so cute and so good at the guitar". It turns out that we lived pretty close by to each other and became friends. After this, when Kanami was recording demos to be sent to record companies, she would contact me to ask "could you play the drums for this song" or ask me to help her out once in a while. Then, in the midst of all this, Kanami was contacted about forming BAND-MAID, and she reached out to me.


- What were your thoughts when you first heard about BAND-MAID?

Akane: I remember Kanami starting the conversation in an extremely apologetic manner <laughter>. It went something like "Umm... does Akane know the agency Platinum Passport?" I knew the name of that agency, so I replied "That's fantastic!", but after that she said "But you see... it's an all-girls' band and...", and I was troubled. I definitely never wanted to be part of an all-girls' band.


- Eh? Really?

Akane: Yes. It wasn't that I hated all-girls' bands, but I had seen so many low-potential girls who would quickly pull out of bands or disband altogether. So I had resistance to forming girls-only bands. But Kanami approached me just at the time where the restaurant in Yokohama where I worked at shut down for good, and I was wondering what to do next. So, I replied "maybe it will be ok since Kanami will be there as well". Then Kanami said "Thank you. And I'm sorry! You see... we will be wearing Maid outfits". Kanami knew my likes and dislikes, so she spoke to me in this manner of revealing details little by little <laughter>. "Maid uniforms huh...", and at that point I had some reservations but at the same time, I thought that I wouldn't be able to do anything without even stepping foot onto the field first. So I said, "even then, I'll do it".


- So you were initially quite hesitant and unsure.

Akane: Quite so <laughter>. But, once I said "in any case, let me hear the music first" and Kanami passed me the demos to listen to, the music was very, very cool! Thereafter, I started thinking "an all-girls' band dressed in Maid outfits and playing such cool music actually sounds quite interesting and fun, and my resistance against Maid outfits and all-girls' bands slowly wore off. Rather, the urge to do something fresh and interesting like this started overflowing and I became very motivated.


- Well then, what were the turning points for you as a drummer, in your drumming journey so far.

Akane: After I started playing the drums in 2nd year of Senior High School, I got to know about Maximum the Hormone. At first, I listened to their music because I thought they were an interesting band, but when I found out that they had a female drummer, I was shocked. Right then, the ideal image of a drummer that I aspired to be was formed, and it was also one of the triggers that made me want to pursue drumming professionally.


- So to say, when you started drumming, your play-style was based on power.

Akane: That's right. I probably realized quite early on that my preference leaned towards rock music. Even at the restaurant where I worked previously, I enjoyed myself the most when I jammed to simple rock music such as Bon Jovi and Deep Purple, rather than Jazz or Fusion music. Back then, I didn't use much twin-pedaling.


- I think Akane-san and Misa-san have been instrumental in the transformation of Band-Maid's sound to its current hard rock musical characteristic. You mentioned not making much use of twin-pedaling at the beginning, but the current Akane-san's twin-pedaling is one of Band-Maid's big weapons.

Akane: While I have used twin-pedaling all this while, it wasn't until "Thrill" that I started incorporating twin-pedal phrases into our music in earnest. It was painful difficult at first. From the amazingly positive response to "Thrill", we decided "let's pursue this direction". From then, there were increasing demands from the members to "include twin-pedals", and I personally wanted to include twin-pedaling aggressively as well. It started with small 1-bar fills or something like that, but gradually the high-speed pedaling increased in frequency. Kanami often writes music with a tempo of about 170 BPM, and there would be times where I would be unable to achieve to respond adequately when tasked to include twin-pedaling into the songs. Because I did not have a proper foundation in twin-pedaling, I would fail at songs with tempo above 130 BPM... But, because we had decided to go with "Hard" musical characteristic, I thought it was essential to be able to use twin-pedals properly and hence I started to change the way I used my legs as a first step. I would look at things such as "I have to actively use the rebounds more", or "in order to achieve this, I have to have improve my ankles' flexibility". While identifying all these issues, I would seek out practice methods in order to solve the issues. For example, constantly moving my ankles while taking a bath, or moving my legs as though twin-pedaling while having meals at home, as though I were shaking my legs unconsciously, in order to commit the twin-pedaling motions to muscle memory...


- It's like training earnestly with the feeling as though you were a beginner.

Akane: Yes. Otherwise, I was totally unable to keep up with the songs' tempo. Also, I did not like having to say "I can't do it" <laughter>. And, the fact that Kanami mercilessly includes twin-pedal phrases into her demos probably means that she believes that I would be able to overcome it, is something that I thought. So... I persevered and tried my hardest to the end.


- Thanks to all that practice, the great feeling we get from Akane-san's drumming is unmatched (compared to that from other drummers). But, there are fans of yours that are worried that you have become slimmer than you used to be due to all your efforts at refining your drumming form and physical conditioning.

Akane: Eh, really? There's nothing to be worried about <laughter>. I've always loved to eat and that hasn't changed. I can finish about 1kg of (cooked) white rice for every meal without sweat <laughter>. I especially love rice and noodles, so much so that my drumming column in GiGS [magazine] is titled "Hey! Drum - Iccho" and uses the motif of Ramen that I love so much <laughter>. But... it's true that I haven't been gaining weight recently. Surely, this is a result of how physically intensive BAND-MAID's drumming is.


- I see. Well then, are you self-aware of what role such an Akane-san plays within BAND-MAID?

Akane: Well... an idiot, I think <laughter>. A character who is played around with by the others [Note: Miku also described herself as such a character in the band].


- Eh!? But isn't Akane-san the band leader...?

Akane: Actually, that is no longer the case. It's true that in the past, the band operated with a leader system and I was chosen as the leader, but BAND-MAID really is made up of members with very strong and distinctive personalities and as we have progressed, various roles have been decided. For example, Kanami is the main composer and the command tower is Saiki. Kobato writes the lyrics and I manage sequencing and other things. In this manner, our distinct rolesgradually solidified and all members commented that "we have become a band where all 5 members have equally important responsibilities to drive the band forward". At that moment, we discontinued the "leader"-led band model. When we had first formed, we didn't know each other and so I was told "Akane looks like the most dependable amongst us, so please become the leader", but now that I think about it, what on earth about me looked dependable, I wonder <laughter>. (Now) I don't have any thoughts or feelings of "I miss being the band leader" or any hard feelings. In fact, I think that the way things work now is a better reflection of ourselves and is great.


- You could almost say it is the complete opposite of the image Akane-san had of an all-girls' band. Getting back on topic, you said you play the role of the band's plaything. In other words... are you the "iyashi type?" [Note: I'm not sure how to translate this properly. Girls described like this would be someone that puts other people at ease, makes them feel comfortable, relaxed, healed].


Akane: No, I don't think I am like that at all. If you had to describe it, I irritate people <laughter>. I am the "clown" of the band, or the one that injects life and noise to situations. I'm often described by members to be "someone I want to call along to "Goukon" [Note: A typical arranged social gathering in Japan between a group of men and women who often don't know each other, usually with the purpose of matchmaking. You can imagine it being a very awkward situation for participants. So someone who can break the ice and get everyone talking is invaluable] <laughter>. Basically, if you put me somewhere, that place or occasion will naturally get very lively, I think? <laughter>.


- I... I see <laughter>. Well then, what is the image of the ideal drummer that Akane-san aspires towards?

Akane: Undoubtedly, I want to become a drummer who can give people a shocking impact, just like the shock I received from the drumming of Maximum The Hormone's Nao. I want to make people who hear BAND-MAID for the first time say "I thought the drummer was a man". I want to carry on proving the fact that music has nothing to do with gender through my drumming and BAND-MAID's music.

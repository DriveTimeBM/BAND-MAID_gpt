- So, what kind of childhood did Saiki-san have?

Saiki: When I was a child... what kind of child was I, I wonder? My parents were divorced and I stayed with my mother. Regarding my father, there is the biological father and the father that raised me, and I definitely have more memories of the father that raised me. My mother was born in and raised in true-blue Osaka fashion, so she doesn't hold anything back and is very aggressive <laughter>. [Note: People from Osaka are well-known to be unique amongst Japanese. They are typically loud, speak their mind, are natural jokers and sometimes border on rowdy and even obnoxious.] Would it come across clearer if I said that she is an older, more intense version of me? <laughter>.

Because she is such a character, it seems that the father that i grew up with actually did not interfere one bit as far as my education and upbringing was concerned. That's why, up until now, I have not been on the receiving end of any anger or scolding by any man, not even once. My mother took on the role of the father as well. It was such a family.

- What kind of character did you have when you were a child?

Saiki: I was a gloomy child. I wasn't lively and was shy, so I liked to play by myself. In kindergarten and lower grades of elementary school. it seems that I did not want to be separated from my mother and so went to school very unwillingly. I have been told that while at home, I would never get off my mother's knees. Therefore, even today, I am often told by my parents and others: "I can't believe that Saiki has turned out like that" <laughter>. They had thought that I had wanted to become a singer, but even in their dreams, who could have guessed that I would become the main vocals of a band that dressed in maid costumes <laughter>. Not to mention speaking so crudely to work up the audience <laughter>.

- Life is interesting, isn't it <laughter>. When did you "awaken" to music?

Saiki: When was it, I wonder? My mother loved to drink sake [alcohol in general?] a lot, and would go to the izakaya [Japanese drinking bar / pub]. I would be having my dinner at the same table where everyone else was drinking <laughter>. Normally, you'd think to go to a Family Restaurant [with child in tow], but in my (family's) case, it was to the izakaya <laughter>. Anyway, in this manner, I would also often go to a "snack" [typical Japanese small-scale drinking bar] run by my mother's friend and there was a karaoke system set up there [once again, very common in a typical "snack"], where I was encouraged "go ahead and sing". I don't know which moment it was that I decided to pursue music, but it was in such an environment that I had started singing from a young age. Oh right, at that time, my mother would request for "songs to cry to", so I sang many heartrending songs such as "nada sou sou" [Okinawan song made famous by Natsukawa Rimi] and "yuki no hana" [by Nakashima Mika], and hence became someone who liked dark and gloomy songs <laughter>. That was around the time when I was in 3rd year of elementary school.

- In the 3rd year of elementary school and singing "nada sou sou". That's quite heavy <laughter>. [Note: a bit hard to translate 渋い as it isn't exactly the literal meaning of the word that is implied, I think]

Saiki: Yes <laughter>. Also, due to my mother's influence, I also liked singers such as Koda Kumi [Japanese R&B/Pop singer from Kyoto], and going with that flow, I became an admirer of Amuro Namie-san [Almost legendary J-pop singer, dancer, producer, model, actress] when I was in 4th or 5th year of elementary school. So I requested to attend a dance school and continued until 1st year of senior high school. Regarding songs, I also liked cool songs such as Amuro Namie-san's, and from there, I started singing songs from various genres as well.

- Seeing Saiki like that, did your mother not recommend that you go for auditions and such?

Saiki: In fact, I was told "why don't you try auditioning?" I was asked to audition, but personally, although I did have the desire that it would nice if I could sing and dance like Amuro-chan, it wasn't a dream that I absolutely had to make come true. So I smoothly shrugged it off with a "nah, that would be impossible" <laughter>. But when I was in first year of junior high school, I was asked "what present do you want for your birthday" and I conveyed my wish that "I want to go to Tokyo to have a look". And later on when I was finally brought to Tokyo, I was scouted on that trip. That was a trigger that made me start to think about many, many things. On top of that, I was scouted by the same agency that managed Amuro Namie-san, so I was super, super happy, and even went for lessons. It was when I went for this lesson that I was scouted by staff of my current agency.

- That you were scouted twice, once again reminds us of the strength of the aura radiating from Saiki-san. The fact that you belong to your current talent agency is the link to you joining BAND-MAID, but what were your feelings when you first heard about this opportunity.

Saiki: At first, I was not told about the band called BAND-MAID, nor was I told anything about wearing maid costumes. The other 4 had already formed BAND-MAID and about one month later, they started auditions for a vocal role in the band. The members as well as the then-manager apparently chose me for auditions based on my profile, but "she will probably refuse if we say anything about the maid costumes" was apparently the conclusion they reached and hence they hid just that key point <laughter>. They approached me very informally and invited me to "just drop by and sing a bit". So I went for the audition and the agency president, song-writers and manager were there but the (band) members were not around. From there, I was told more and more about the project and once the "box was opened", I remember going "Eh? Maid costumes?". I thought I was well and truly done in <laughter>.

- I guess you would feel that way <laughter>. But, did you also think that it was an opportunity?

Saiki: At the previous agency, I had gone for vocal lessons anyway, and the will to do this for real got stronger and stronger. In any case this was the period where would I try out for any kind of audition and would take on any anything because I wanted a job. So... I decided to do it (BAND-MAID). Although, in my heart, I was thinking "is this really going to be ok?" <laughter>. When I heard the details, I recall going "for real? maid costumes? And a rock band? Isn't that way too new (different)?" <laughter>. I was the worst at handling things like frilly/fluffy clothes and cutesy songs, so when the songwriters gave the demos of shortlisted songs and I sensed that a certain song had a cute feeling, I would secretly convey my feelings that "I think this song is not good" <laughter>.

- So from way back then, already shades of (Saiki) the "command tower", I see... Well then, if I were to ask what songs or situations were a turning point for you since you started singing for BAND-MAID?

Saiki: The first "okyuji" [BAND-MAID liver performance - "service"] I performed at as part of BAND-MAID was at SHIBUYA-AX. It had such a shocking impact, and I came to like doing these services. On the other hand, "this is the costume, huh...". At the beginning, the costume had an apron attached. After the SHIBUYA-AX service, I could not take it any longer and with a shout of "Just as I thought, I hate wearing this!", I threw the apron away <laughter>.

- It is indeed important to have a mind of your own. But if you had said "I want to sing in jeans and a T-Shirt", it would have been troubling for the other members and the staff, right?

Saiki: Up until then, I had not experienced "singing while wearing a certain costume", so I actually enjoyed putting on a costume. As I continued with BAND-MAID, this (wearing a costume) became something very normal and I actually couldn't remember what it felt like when I used to sing while dressed in my own clothes. Now, it has actually reversed to the point where I feel it would be embarrassing to perform on stage in my own clothes <laughter>. But, I was indeed uncomfortable with it for the 1st year or so. Moreover, the first costume design was white lace on a black base, with a short swishy skirt... I hated the obvious intention of the design. I started liking my costume when I started to have a say in the color and design.

- Indeed, I think that BAND-MAID's attractiveness has increased now that each member is able to bring out and show their different personalities. Additionally, while the visual concept is "cute / adorable", based on (the band's) work and activities, (BAND-MAID) has become a "cool" band.

Saiki: We are told that very often. Where (when) was this transformation, I wonder? We were happier when told that we were "cool" rather than "cute", so we focused on growing in that direction. Initially, it seemed like an exercise in futility (doing the same thing over and over to turn opinions), but slowly and surely, we started being referred to as "cool", and we felt "they are finally realizing it" and were very happy about it.

- You've built up the unique image of a band which brings out the most of "the gap". As a turning point, I think the surgery you had last year for vocal cord polyps was also huge.

Saiki: For around 2 years leading up to the surgery, I was dealing with a throat that was not in good condition. It wasn't that I suddenly lost my voice, but it was a slowly worsening condition. When I first joined BAND-MAID, we performed at a pace of about 10 live performances per month. Thinking about it now, although it wasn't a particularly difficult number (of performances), but my throat hadn't got used to live performances yet back then. My voice quality was never the crystal clear type, but starting from when the other members said to me "Hmm, your voice seems to be rougher than usual today", the condition gradually got worse and worse.

- Come to think of it, before your operation, your voice used to be a lot more husky when conversing normally in situations like this (interview).

Saiki: My words were so faint that you couldn't hear what I was saying <laughter>. I would often get told "Huh? What? Could you say that again?". Due to this condition, I tried not to use my voice except during live performances, but I am the type that actually loves to talk, you know? Once I started drinking I would go on talking non-stop, and finally, the condition became too serious <laughter>.

- But, since you were still singing even though your (throat) condition was bad, wasn't it a very difficult decision to go ahead with the surgery?

Saiki: Honestly, I was terrified to go for surgery. So, I thought of ways to carry on while having this throat condition and used many "cheating" methods when singing. However, I thought that if I didn't properly reset my condition once, it would definitely become a hindrance in my activities in the future and hence made up my mind in the summer of 2017. It was quick once I had decided. I said "It is no longer possible to pretend this issue doesn't exist. Let's do this!" <laughter>.

- A shy child that couldn't bear to separate from her mother became someone who decided to go for surgery on her own accord...

Saiki: I've indeed become like that, huh <laughter>. Now, my mother... seems to have mellowed as she has aged. No that's not it. She is still aggressive, but is less decisive compared to before. Regarding the surgery, she asked me many times "Will it really be ok?", so I think that right now, I am a more decisive person than she is. Although, I also have a feeling that I am becoming similar to how my mother was when she was younger.

- Probably, I think you have had a very strong core since you were a child. It was a big decision to go for the surgery, but your singing since going for surgery has an increased sense of stability and awesomeness compared to before.

Saiki: Thank you very much. Around the time of recording "alone" (released in "Brand New MAID" in May 2016), we started engaging the help of a vocal director and I also made use of his [or her?] voice training method. He had also experienced polyp surgery before, so while saying "eventually, you will have no choice but to go for surgery", he taught me many methods to care for my throat and voice, and vocal techniques to reduce the burden on my vocal cords. For the 2 years that my throat was having this bad condition,I could at most sing at about 60% of my full power, so it also limited what I was able to do. When recording songs, the time we had was limited and so within that time, I'd go "let's record the main track before I'm unable to produce any sound. We'll do the layering another day". This actually became quite stressful. After I got "my new throat", I was able to do everything I wanted to do vocally, so singing became enjoyable (again).

- That's great. Well then, what does Saiki-san think is appealing, attractive and extremely enjoyable unique to being the vocalist?

Saiki: What indeed... I've never actually thought about it before. I think that the vocalist in bands is often the symbol of the band or the front-man, but I personally don't really feel that way. Because I have Kobato standing next to me, I let her take on those roles, and that's an important reason. It's like "I'll just sing so you take care of everything else ok?" <laughter>. Kobato Miku, the character, or, the mascot, who is the easily recognizable front-man is standing alongside me, so I just go "I'll just sing a bit over here". Therefore, it's not that I don't think about it at all, but I really don't put much thought into this matter.

- So your feelings of "I'm the (lead) vocals so I want to stand out the most" is not strong?

Saiki: Rather than that, It might even be correct to say that I want to stand out the least <laughter>. I think I have strong feelings of wanting to make Kobato stand out the most. The position where I currently stand is actually ideal for myself. I've tried as far as possible to reduce stress on myself and that has resulted in my current condition. I'm the type that is not suited to having expectations placed on me, so it's great that Kobato is there for me. It's something like "It's ok because Kobato will take on all that for me" <laughter>.

- What a great combination <laughter>. Well then, what role do you think you play within BAND-MAID?

Saiki: I'm often asked to make the final decision on matters to be decided as a band, so I guess that is my role? I separate my likes and dislikes pretty clearly and draw a line between cool (good) and lame (bad) things, so although it is simply a matter of voicing out my opinion, matters are often decided by my words. The members would come to me to ask "what do you think of this song?" or "what do you think of this arrangement?", and if I think that it sucks, I would say "it sucks" without mincing my words. If I feel that an arrangement is lackluster, I'd say "I don't feel any effort" <laughter>. It't not that I think "I will decide matters for the band", but rather just straightforward voicing out things that I feel.

- You could say that it is proof that everyone trusts Saiki-san, that there are no hard feelings and things are still smooth even with what you just described. Also, I think that it's a big positive for the band to have a member who speaks her mind critically.

Saiki: Really?

- If the members know that even if they produce a halfhearted piece of work, it would be shot down (by Saiki), wouldn't the quality of songs and performances increase naturally?

Saiki: Ah, if you put it that way, you may be right. I don't know when things became like that, it just kind of happened. ...No, perhaps I said it right from the beginning. "Horrible! Where on earth did you find those clothes?" or something like that <laughter>.

- So, you even criticize their everyday clothes? <laughter>

Saiki: Yes, occassionally <laughter>. I feel that girls who play in a band seem to be most interested in their instruments, and following fashion trends seems to be lower on their priority list. I suppose that there are people out there who say "You don't need to be so particular about casual clothes", but it bothers me... or rather if I think that the clothes look terrible I will speak my mind <laughter>. But, now I already understand each member's preferences, so I won't simply stop at "that sucks", but rather go "hey there's a cute shop that just opened over there, why don't we go together?" <laughter>.

- I think the members are happy that you give them fashion advice based on their individual preferences rather than force your personal preferences upon them. Well then, what is the ideal image of a vocalist that Saiki-san aspires to become?

Saiki: There isn't any particular ideal image. I have always liked Amuro-chan, though. I think I will admire that person for the rest of my life. Although we are different genres and visual styles, I purely admire Amuro-chan's aura and power to charm and attract people. No ideal image comes to mind as far as singing style and performance is concerned, but I do want to become a vocalist who can solidly attract people.

Akane controls Band-Maid’s beats with her technical and physical drumming skills. As Band-Maid basically write songs on DAW, it’s not uncommon for them to come up with somewhat superhuman drum patterns, but she has always overcome them and kept improving. She talked with us about how their collaboration with The Warning had a big impact on her, and her ambitions as a drummer.

― In which song on Epic Narratives did you personally challenge yourself?

Akane: The song I challenged myself in was Protect You. I played blast beat in the intro. I had used it just a little before, like for two bars, but this time, I fully used it in the intro. I studied from the basics again, like what blast beat is.

― Which song do you feel particularly attached to on this album?

Akane: It’s SHOW THEM. I played the twin drum kits with Pau (drummer) of The Warning, and I learned a lot from listening to another player’s drumming up close at the recording. I interacted with her on her audio recording settings, her performance, and her attitude toward recording, in the direction. Also, we played the drums side by side at the serving, and we were both like “This is great” just after a few plays at the rehearsal. I think the fact that we match each other well is the proof that we both have built a good foundation of the basics. I felt like we matched well because we were both conscious about the part of the snare to hit, timing, and groove, and that made me think what I had been doing wasn’t wrong. It was so refreshing and fun.

― Did Pau-san’s influence change any aspects of you specifically?

Akane: Like, how I make sounds, how fast my shot speed is, and how I listen to the clicks. Since we played the same phrases, even a single swing of hers had something to learn from, like how she holds her sticks. Pau is such a dynamic drummer, like when we are waiting for the next song to start, I just look down and get into the rhythm but she kind of performs even when she’s not drumming. She looks at me with full confidence in all the sections. I think it’s partly because of her personality, but I learned a lot from how she steps forward in her performance.

― Looking back on your activities, which song was a turning point for you personally?

Akane: There were two songs, one of which was Moratorium (2017). Its main part is almost entirely double bass drumming, so it’s a song where I keep kicking the double pedal all through to make the beat. At that time, we Band-Maid were gradually firming up our musical direction, and I just really started using the double pedal, so I couldn’t keep kicking it yet. There was a moment when I almost gave up and got a negative thought that maybe the drummer of Band-Maid shouldn’t be me and they should have another girl who kicks it better than me, but I couldn’t give up after all. I came to think I had no choice but to do it. I took lessons and studied myself once again about double bass drumming, and I came to see myself in Band-Maid as a drummer of double bass drumming, a drummer using a double pedal, then. At the same time, that was when I developed an image of myself as such a drummer, so Moratorium was the turning point when it comes to double bass drumming.

― What is the other song?

Akane: It’s BLACK HOLE. It’s a drum-centric song with such intense drums that it gave me another core when I grew enough to play it perfectly. I picked the two songs where the drummer can play the lead role and that our fans want me to play.

― Akane-san, what does Band-Maid mean to you?

Akane: It’s a band I bet my life on. That means it has changed my life and I have strong will and desire to do it until I die. I didn’t know there was something I could keep doing this seriously. I’d say my bandmates are more than my family.

― Around when did you start thinking it’s important like that?

Akane: I had the strong feeling from the very beginning because I joined the band with a determination that it would be the last band to join in my music life. It has been so since the moment when I decided to be Band-Maid’s Akane. The reason why we’ve been able to continue this long without any change in members is because we’re always going in the same direction. I think the fact that we’re entering our 12th year is strong proof of that.

― Please tell us what you want to do and your ambitions with Band-Maid in the future.

Akane: I hope all the five of us Band-Maid will be seen as lead roles. It’s true we play vocal hard rock with a lead vocalist, but I think our greatest strength is that we give highlights to each of us. I hope we will become a band that people all over the world think so. I think drummers tend to step back because the drums support the band. That’s precisely why I want to be a drummer who has a presence as one of the lead roles and who people want to be like.

## Band-Maid: Persevering tirelessly in upholding justice

No pain, no gain. Justice of the five members of Band-Maid tirelessly improving themselves and evolving without compromising their ideals.

Band-Maid’s activities never fail to intrigue. Zen and Ready to Rock, released digitally in January and in April respectively, and What is justice?, newly released on July 18, are all TV anime tie-ins. The rapid pace of releasing a new song every three months is remarkable in itself, but what’s even more impressive is how each new track conveys the band’s growth and evolution.

Moreover, the songs are intricately linked to their changing, multi-layered live performance, creating an exciting sense of interaction between their song releases and concerts.

In this interview, we spoke with all the members about the driving force behind their unstoppable growth. The conversation took place on July 10, two days before the start of the Second Round of “Band-Maid Tour 2025”.

- We’ve been having some hot days. The Second Round of the tour finally starts in two days, doesn’t it?

Kanami: In two days? Insane!

- What’s insane about it?

Kanami: The setlists are absolutely insane. We had a dress rehearsal (a run-through done just like a real show) yesterday, and Saiki made setlists that even we, after going through the First Round of the tour, were completely exhausted by, so when you said “two days”, I felt a bit of pressure like “Oh, it’s happening in two days!”

Saiki: Ha ha ha!

Kanami: There are still some parts we need to work on a little harder, so yeah, insane.

- Are the setlists that rigorous?

Saiki: Yes. While respecting the flow from the First Round, I made them just a bit richer.

Kanami: Just a bit…? (laughs)

- The First Round was already almost too rich, and now even more?

Miku Kobato: It totally surpasses that, po.

Akane: I was surprised there could be setlists that surpass that (laughs).

- It sounds a little scary.

Miku Kobato: That’s right, po. Actually, during yesterday’s dress rehearsal, we were thinking “Will our masters and princesses (fans) be all right?”, po.

- Thank you for your consideration (laughs). But I think the reason you want to make such setlists is because you realize that your evolution and growth haven’t stopped.

Saiki: Exactly. We released the album Epic Narratives in September last year and a series of new tie-in songs this year, which is the tightest production schedule we Band-Maid have ever had. And we’ve been touring at the same time, so we want to reflect our growth in real time through our servings and let you feel it. I’m constantly updating our setlists so that our growth will come across to everyone.

- Hearing that makes me even more excited to see what’s going to happen in two days. I’m not hoping for any trouble to happen, of course. But as you said, your new songs have come out one after the other at a great tempo, and lately I’ve noticed your band’s sound has been getting thicker. Saiki-san, perhaps you notice this change more than anyone else, since the sound comes from behind you, what do you think?

Saiki: You mean a change in how I hear our sound, right? Yes, yes, the sound images from my bandmates have become clearer, and our equipment has literally been upgraded steadily, so I suppose the sound that reaches the audience has improved along with the stage sound around me. Two years ago, on our 10th anniversary, we realized again that we are a live band, and our feelings about servings have… not exactly changed but become more aware of the sound we should deliver and we’ve worked on it. I think the change is a result of that.

- You are all nodding. Have you had any specific discussions about what you were aiming for in sound image or how it should sound?

Kanami: We’ve been talking about improving our sound and improving our equipment for a while, of course, but we’ve been becoming more conscious of enhancing our sense of groove. Since… around last year?

Misa: No, I think it was two years ago. I think we were already discussing it around the time of Yokohama Arena two years ago (the 10th anniversary show at Yokohama Arena held on November 26, 2023).

Miku Kobato: Yeah. We’ve been gradually conscious of it since two years ago, and refining it more since last year, po, right?

Kanami: That was when we started paying more attention to the backbeat.

Saiki: We aligned our groove, right?

Kanami: Yeah. This is a little technical, but we were like “Let’s match our timing here” or “Let’s be more conscious of the timing of the beats 2 and 4 here”, and after aligning our understanding like that, we each practiced individually, slowing the clicks to half-speed to further improve our backbeat… I suppose that as a result of working on these detailed basic training, our band’s groove improved technically, which impacted our overall sound… maybe?

Saiki: Yes, very much so (laughs).

Akane: I definitely think so.

Saiki: I feel like we each communicate through sound more closely now. You know, we all really dig into the details in this band (laughs). Before, we just matched things at a level like “Yeah, we’re doing something detailed”. But we revisited each part, checking how every instrument comes in, and where and how the sounds join together. And when we actually play it, it turns out a bit different from the composition stage, so we digested finer details mentally and deepen our understanding. Then we sometimes realize again like “Oh, we only need to match this second beat!” For vocal melodies, in Band-Maid songs, we usually need to match them to the drum rhythm, but by digging deeper, we’ve started to notice things like “Ah, so the bass comes in here like this”. We’ve developed more mental space and prepared ourselves based on all of those things… Doesn’t it feel like we have more mental space now, actually?

Akane: Yeah. As our comprehension has increased, I think controlling note values (note lengths on a musical score) has become easier.

Saiki: I’ve also realized it’s not enough to just keep up with the rhythm.

Miku Kobato: As a result, I think the resolution of each song has become higher, po.

- So, it seems like that’s a result of trying to go one step beyond just being perfectly in sync during your information-laden performance, isn’t it?

Miku Kobato: That’s right, po.

Saiki: Band-Maid songs have a structure with a lot of changes and kind of demand different grooves for each development in a song. So I think learning each song more precisely allowed us to raise our level overall.

- You mentioned earlier that you started paying more attention to groove around the time of the Yokohama Arena show. Did that have anything to do with the sense of scale or groove required to perform in a big venue?

Misa: Partly yes, but the bigger factor was the change in our songs themselves.

Saiki: Yeah. I think the change in the songs and the change in our mindset because of it played a bigger role. We became more conscious of reaching our audience. We started to thinking about the depth of communication both for us performing on stage and for the people receiving it. In other words, it was like “Just playing music isn’t enough to get our message across, is it?” So we were like “Let’s put more emotion into it!”

- I see. As the resolution of a song increases, you will certainly start to see what you should and shouldn’t do. But when a keyword like “groove” comes up, there’s no single solution like “We’ll get that if we do this”, you know. Even if you try all kinds of things, results aren’t guaranteed. I imagine that was quite a struggle for you, wasn’t it?

Misa: That’s true, but more than that, I didn’t fully understand what is my own groove. I used to just play what felt OK, so I’m not even sure if I was really producing what you’d call groove back then.

Akane: Yeah. We used to just try to get in sync with each other, playing with this vague feeling like “As long as we’re in sync and it feels good, that’s fine, right?” I don’t think we were able to fully pursue it or understand it.

Misa: Back then, we thought the most important thing was playing correctly. Band-Maid songs basically have a lot of notes, and playing them accurately is non-negotiable. But I feel like when we were stuck on that, we hadn’t reached what you’d call groove. That’s how I feel now, and I think Band-Maid’s groove has finally been established and I’ve come to understand my own groove.

- It’s your own groove and at the same time the right groove for the band.

Akane: At the recording, when I record the drums first, I can make requests and exchanges more specifically and smoothly now, like “The drums have this groove, so match to them”.

- Do you look back on your past and ever think, for example, “Oh, we weren’t musically mature back then”?

Misa: Yes, definitely. Like, we were really like babies at the beginning (laughs).

Saiki: Sometimes we watch old footage of us, you know. We have our own site of video content, and our old video works are posted there from time to time, and when I see them, I think “This is so embarrassing!” (laughs) I can’t help but feel that way.

Miku Kobato: We each took our own parts way too seriously, po (laughs).

Saiki: But I can see how hard I was trying, so I like to praise my past self, thinking “Good job, you didn’t make any mistakes” (laughs). You have to cherish your past self like that…

Miku Kobato: Without that, we wouldn’t be who we are now, po (laughs).

- After hearing your talk, I’m beginning to see the reasons of your evolution a little more clearly. For example, I feel like your past songs sound different when you play them at servings now. Actually, that’s where I feel your growth most.

Saiki: We feel that a lot too.

Akane: When we play an old song for the first time in a while during a rehearsal, I often forget how I played it back then.

Saiki: Some songs have changed so much that I wonder “What did I use as a cue back then?”

Misa: I think Thrill has changed a lot. When we play it now, it’s clearly heavier than before.

Miku Kobato: It’s like “Isn’t this a different song?” in a way, po.

Saiki: Yeah. But at the same time, I think, “This is exactly what we wanted to do back then”. It’s just something we couldn’t achieve at that time, and as for Thrill, I remember thinking “This feels light for some reason”.

- So you didn’t understand why it didn’t feel heavy at the time, did you?

Miku Kobato: That’s right, po.

Saiki: We thought “This must be fine, but it doesn’t feel right”. That was all we understood. We knew we could do something cooler but we didn’t know why it didn’t work out.

Akane: We gave 100% every time, and after growing from that, we were like “Hmm? Something is off”. We went through that process over and over, and we’ve finally made it this far.

- You gave 100% at any moment matter-of-factly, and now you can give 120% or 150% of what you were able to give back then. And there must be times when you don’t have to give your all now.

Saiki: Exactly. We’ve learned the value of subtraction or rather reduction since we became able to check our groove as a band.

- Having space in your songs must make it easier for the audience to engage. I just remembered reading Aki Yashiro-san say somewhere that she was told “Don’t put too much emotion into your songs, or there won’t be room for the listener’s emotions to go into.”

Miku Kobato: That’s certainly true with singing, po. If you overdo it, even things that naturally come across end up not coming across. Also, if there’s too much that comes across from the start, the interpretation becomes fixed, po, probably.

Saiki: You wouldn’t be able to use your imagination.

Miku Kobato: Right. It’s not good to be too self-contained, po.

Saiki: That’s true.

- It’s interesting, isn’t it? In any case, the flow of the last two years must have been crucial for your growth as a band.

Kanami: Yes, but we still have a long way to go.

Saiki: I agree, we still have a really long way to go.

Kanami: None of us are satisfied with ourselves at all yet, so we keep practicing the basics every day, believing we can go even further.

Miku Kobato: Also at rehearsals, we constantly improve each song’s resolution through trial and error, like “This part shouldn’t be like this” or something, po.

- You guys are literally persevering tirelessly, like in the lyrics of Sense (laughs). Kobato-san, haven’t you noticed a change in how you hear or feel the overall sound too, as your guitar skills have improved?

Miku Kobato: Yes, po, because at first, I really didn’t know what was right or wrong and I just had to play without even knowing if my rhythm was correct. In that sense, even though I, Kobato, still have a really long way to go, I’ve started to see the right answers for rhythm and understand how to get a proper backbeat… which may seem trivial, but I think it actually leads to something really important musically, po.

- I understand. Saiki-san, in your case, I imagine things have changed since you started playing the piano or keyboard. What’s your honest impression?

Saiki: Tons of changes (laughs). I play an electronic keyboard, which has no tuning, you know. When my bandmates each tune their instruments, my ears hear the accurate do-re-mi, so I’ve become much more sensitive to pitch. I notice details I would have said “It’s probably OK” about before.

Kanami: Saiki sometimes points out, “Your bending’s pitch was a little too high”. She’s become really strict about her own pitch as well as ours. She can give us more accurate pitches since she started the keyboard, so we in the axe team often get surprised (laughs). I’m like “I played a little too high just now, Saiki must have noticed” (laughs).

Saiki: In that sense, maybe I’m the one who has changed the most over the last few years. I pay more attention to details now, but not only that, I’m also more committed.

- And thanks to that, I’m sure you can give more specific requests to your bandmates now.

Kanami: Actually, at yesterday’s dress rehearsal, she said to me “Kanami, isn’t your guitar range a little high overall today?” and I was like “Oh, I increased the presence a little more than usual today. I’ll turn it down.” She’s now really good at catching those finer ranges and the sounds we are producing at the moment.

- You have that great vibe of “Do you think I’m deaf?”

Saiki: Ha ha ha! But you’re right, now I don’t just accept things that I went along with back then like “No problem, that’ll be fine”.

- I see. You’ve become able to ask for greater precision. But now that you’ve mastered the right notes, you must also have the joy of just going with the flow to see what happens.

Saiki: I totally agree. I suppose we have more varieties of fun now.

- You guys write songs every day while feeling this evolution, don’t you? If so, I imagine there must be a change in the image of yourselves that you want to convey through your songs in some way. Like, until recently, many Band-Maid songs were known for dense arrangements and an impressive speedy feel, but I think lately there have been songs with a sense of subtraction where every note stands out. I feel like the change comes from the higher resolution of your band sound. What do you think, Kanami-san?

Kanami: Rather, what do you think, guys? (laughs)

Saiki: Things like our vision of presenting ourselves as a band and the type of songs we want to play have changed over time, but when it comes to songwriting, I think Kanami’s own approach has changed. I feel like she asks each of us to do things more precisely now. With five strong personalities in the band, I feel like she’s better at organizing us now.

Kanami: That might be true. Maybe I’ve been asking Misa for a lot more from her bass lately.

Misa: That’s right. But Kanami’s requests are easy to understand, so there’s no problem at all.

- So you guys get clearer and more specific requests now. But I think, generally, the longer you have been together as a band and the deeper you understand each other, the less you need to make requests.

Saiki: Kanami herself was the type who doesn’t make a lot of requests, actually.

Kanami: Oh, was I?

Saiki: She didn’t really talk much about the songs…

Miku Kobato: That’s right, po. Rather, she was more likely to say things like “It’s OK”.

Saiki: She was like “It’s OK, because we all write this together”. Then, probably because of the influence of having more tie-ins than before, she started giving us a much clearer image for each song and making more specific requests, like “Go with this voice range” or “Use this number of notes”. She started saying things like that.

Akane: That’s certainly true.

Kanami: It’s true I didn’t really explain things like “This song means this” or something before, and when I told so for the first time in an interview, my bandmates were often like “Oh, was that so?” (laughs)

Akane: For drum fills, Kanami used to be pretty much like “Just do whatever you like”, but now she has a strong image of what she wants, so she says things like “This is better” or “I want this part to be like this”. When I actually make changes based on her requests, she gives me feedback like a proofreader (laughs).

Kanami: What a picky person I am! (laughs)

Akane: Not at all! (laughs)

Saiki: You’re funny! (laughs)

Miku Kobato: I think Kanami’s strong sense of how Band-Maid songs should be is showing in a better way than ever, po.

Saiki: She’s become more like a professional composer.

Akane: It’s easier to share the image of a song now. We can go into recordings with that image in mind.

Saiki: Yeah. That helps a lot.

Kanami: Really?

Miku Kobato: Yes, it’s true, po. It’s easy to understand because you’re so clear now.

Kanami: I’m relieved! But I can complete songs as Band-Maid music precisely because my bandmates arrange them this way. That feeling hasn’t changed at all, but I’m not really sure myself whether my composing style or my view on composition has ever changed. I’m basically free to compose whatever I want every time, and when I share it, my bandmates always say “This is great!”… so it brings me to tears (laughs). Thank you so much.

Saiki: You crybaby! (laughs)

- No, you can’t cry, because you have a photoshoot after this (laughs). Anyway, Kanami-san, since you have a clear idea of what you want in your head, you can make clear requests, and you guys can get them easily. That naturally makes it easier to work on.

Saiki: It really has become smooth.

- So it allows you to work faster and to tackle one after another. I imagine you toss around ideas, if not objections, like “This could be even better” during that process, don’t you?

Misa: In my case, I do it through my sound rather than through conversation.

Kanami: I totally understand that. Misa certainly responds with her sound rather than words like “I think this is better, so why don’t we change it like this?” And I reply “I think that’s good, let’s go with it”.

Miku Kobato: Conversation through sound. That’s cool, po (laughs).

Kanami: It really is a conversation through sound.

- Sure, there must be times when you can communicate that way faster than words. I think it’s a privilege of a band to be able to do that.

Kanami: On the other hand, Akane is the type who tells me specifically “I want to do it like this because…”

Akane: With reasons why.

Miku Kobato: That shows your honest personality, po (laughs).

Kanami: In Saiki and Kobato’s case, they respond like “This is the result” or “It turned out like this after recording”. They do tell me important points but usually they just send me finished versions.

- What about the impact of tie-ins? After all, you can’t do it without mutual communication with the client, and it has to make both sides happy, you know. It wouldn’t be good if only the client’s requests were met, and it would be meaningless if it ended up something far from Band-Maid. But in your case, every tie-in has landed perfectly. I’m curious about the 90-second versions, which are always needed for anime or similar tie-ins. I guess writing them is a training in some way.

Kanami: Actually, I write a 90-second version only after writing a full-length version each time. First, I write a full version, verse and chorus, and send it to them, and after they say “Let’s go with this”, I write a full-length version, then I ask myself “Now, what about the 90-second?”

Miku Kobato: So it’s not that we write a 90-second beforehand and then a full version, po.

Kanami: When I write a 90-second version, sometimes I’m like “Oh snap, this is not long enough for 90 seconds”, or “I have no choice but to make an anime version” and add some elements before and after it. In any case, I always start with the full-length version.

- I see. Some people seem to write 90-second versions first for a presentation, so I thought you might write them first and then expand them from there.

Saiki: But Kanami, in your case, don’t you write a verse and chorus that fits in 90 seconds even without realizing it?

Kanami: Really? I didn’t know that myself.

Saiki: It’s usually about 90 seconds long.

- Maybe it’s imprinted in Kanami-san’s biological clock.

Saiki: That’s possible. The structure and the like of her composition naturally take that length into account. But I’m sure a 90-second version makes it easier for clients to get a clear image.

- Yes, I think so. When you write a full-length version and then summarize it into 90 seconds, I feel like it helps you develop the ability to grasp the essence of the song and summarize it. You’ve honed the skills to create something compact yet with a storylike structure maybe thanks to producing 90-second versions repeatedly.

Miku Kobato: I agree. We are probably trained a lot through trying to make something unique to the anime, po.

Kanami: I’m conscious of the need to manage well to convey the appeal of the song within 90 seconds, and I certainly feel like I’m getting better at writing 90-second versions. I’ve become better at writing them for anime than before thanks to all these opportunities… maybe?

Saiki: Yeah, you have (laughs).

Miku Kobato: And you’ve become a lot faster, po.

Kanami: I might have been getting used to it. I think that certainly works in a positive way.

- Of all the tie-ins, I think Ready to Rock was really important. It was the opening theme song for the TV anime Rock Is a Lady’s Modesty, and you were involved more deeply than just providing the song. Maybe because of that, the reaction from your masters and princesses looked different. I don’t think you’ve ever been this immersed in an anime itself before.

Saiki: Right, I don’t think we’ve ever seen a reaction that big before.

Miku Kobato: I think we were able to have an even stronger connection with the work because of the working style of immersing ourselves in the world of the anime, po.

Saiki: I was simply so happy to see a lot of people on social media literally writing this like “I can’t wait for next week’s episode”. I was surprised and happy they loved everything about it.

- And you all enjoyed everything about it as a band.

Akane: Yes. And we grew a lot through it too.

Saiki: Because we were involved in it deeper than anything before.

Akane: Like, our movements were used in the anime through motion capture, and all the sounds in the performance scenes were our own. I was happy also for those new challenges. There were so many first things for us.

Saiki: I thought it was a rare opportunity to do so many new things after being around for this many years.

Kanami: We had the pleasure of actually meeting the director. We hadn’t had such an opportunity before, so we were able to actually talk with him about the people making the anime and many other things, which made Ready to Rock even more special. He said he will be coming to see us live at Toyosu Pit again.

Akane: I agree. Hiroshi Fukuda-sensei, the original manga author, also came to see us at a shooting. I felt his great passion for the work, and learning those things really made us feel the sense of family.

Miku Kobato: We were really grateful he loved the anime including us.

- So it felt like you were all part of one team.

Saiki: That’s absolutely true. I feel like we’ve never been this close to a production team before.

- Since it’s a story about girls who play instruments, viewers must have had the joy of seeing you Band-Maid through the characters. And as for What is justice? This time, I’ve heard you guys wrote it a while ago, but the fact that it ended up coming out after Ready to Rock is a great flow of events.

Kanami: That’s right. We composed the song itself last year, but the recording was very recent, and Saiki worked really hard on it there.

Saiki: The vocal range is so high throughout the chorus that I was like “Give me a break!” (laughs)

- That’s what makes it so cool. By the time this article comes out, the Second Round of the tour will have already finished, but there will be a short gap until the Final Round, won’t it? I’ve heard you will proceed a new production during that time, and something that’s neither a single nor an album will be released before the Final Round.

Miku Kobato: Yes, as we promised, we’re releasing a new EP, po! All the songs are ready, but we still have some songs to record.

Saiki: At the moment, there are a couple of songs we haven’t recorded yet. However, things like the cover artwork and the overall concept of the EP are nearly complete.

- Of course it must be still too early to ask about the contents of the record, but what kind of EP do you think it’s going to be, roughly?

Saiki: As for the positioning of Eps for us Band-Maid, it meant extremely a lot for us to be able to release Unleash after the COVID pandemic. I don’t think we’ve released a record where we put ourselves forward more clearly than it, including the theme of “unleash”. In addition, it’s very memorable because we moved on to working on the album to celebrate our 10th anniversary from there. I’m sure our new EP will take over the Band-Maid story like that. This year marks our 12th anniversary, and next year is a new milestone of the 10th anniversary of our major-label debut. We’ve seen so many new people through the three songs we released this year: Zen, Ready to Rock, and What is justice?. In fact, we’ve been directly feeling at servings that there are really a lot of people coming to see us live for the first time, so we think of it as a good opportunity to once again show what Band-Maid is, also with the meaning of “nice to meet you”. So, in a sense, this EP will be something like our representative work.

Miku Kobato: We expect it to be a record densely packed with various genres we’ve done up until now, like a representation of the current Band-Maid we’ve become thanks to our past 12 years, po.

- In other words, even though it’s an EP with not many songs, it’s a kind of latest greatest-hits album, isn’t it?

Saiki: That’s right. We’d like to create a record that will reach people who have only recently found us Band-Maid and that will be enjoyable for people who have been listening to us for a long time, and at the same time, we’d like it to give them a sense of our future. We hope they will walk into the future with us and look forward to what lies ahead of us Band-Maid. We’d like to make an EP that will highten their anticipation and also will lead into our next album.

- So, in a sense, it’s like a starting point for your future after 2026, isn’t it?

Saiki: That’s right. It feels like if we’re going to release a record now, it will be this. I think albums can be pretty hard to get into for new listeners. And in our case, we really emphasize the storyline of an album, so we’re quite particular about each song on it. On the other hand, Eps have a more free aspect, and this time the three tie-in songs will be included, so I think people will also have the joy of listening to them again on the record.

- That’s interesting. Even though the three songs each have a different theme, all of them are right in the middle of the Band-Maid style at this moment.

Saiki: That’s absolutely true. I think we can’t miss this perfect timing of this year after releasing the three songs. It makes me think that a mysterious coincidence like that can happen.

Kanami: What’s more, this EP will include some experimental songs that will make you go like “Whoa, is this Band-Maid?”

Saiki: After all, we’d like to surprise our listeners, you know (laughs). Kanami wrote perfect songs in that sense.

Kanami: There’s one song that started when I asked “What do you think about something like this?” and received responses like “It might be interesting”. There’s one more song that feels new. Also, we decided to make a song that would serve as a name card like “We are Band-Maid”, and we all tried to come up with a structure together for the first time. After having a good discussion to make that kind of song.

- That sounds interesting too. So, there are times when Kanami-san gives more specific and detailed direction than ever before, and other times when you all try to incorporate each of your own ideas precisely because you are now able to do that. I feel like you’ll take the EP one or two steps further by working in both of those ways.

Akane: That’s right. Of course I hope they will feel what Band-Maid is like through this EP, but at the same time I don’t want anyone to think “Oh, this kind of music again?”, and I’m amazed myself that the EP is not going to make you think so (laughs). In fact, it’s so Band-Maid while still giving you a sense of our growth for sure.

Misa: We’re working on it seriously but we’re having fun. There are songs that feel like that. I’m excited it’s going to be a really good EP.

- You can have fun exactly because you are working on it seriously.

Miku Kobato: That’s absolutely true. And while it’s an EP in terms of size, it’s going to have the same amount of calories as an album, po.

Saiki: Like, it’s categorized as an EP for sales reasons (laughs).

Akane: Actually either way is fine (laughs). Anyway, I’m sure you’ll be able to enjoy seeing our growth in it.

- With your schedule including the upcoming tour, you’ll present the EP as your new name card and then enter the Final Round. Isn’t the Tokyo Garden Theater show in December going to be really tough?

Miku Kobato: Considering how tough the Second Round already looks even before it begins, I can’t even imagine.

Kanami: And the songs on the EP are actually difficult.

Misa: Oh, we’ll have to play the songs on the EP in the Final Round! (holding her head)

Saiki: I’ve been telling you! (laughs)

Misa: When I’m concentrating on what’s in front of me, I forget things easily (laughs).

- You’ve got a long-term plan for what you want to work on, but at the same time there’s so much happening right now that you can hardly think ahead. Maybe that’s actually a good thing.

Saiki: I think that probably suits us Band-Maid (laughs).

Miku Kobato: We keep growing every day… and it’s nice we have to keep growing, po.

Kanami: Rather, we might have a hard time if we had too much downtime.

Saiki: You’re right. That would make me feel like I need something to do.

Akane: I’d start to feel guilty, like I’m the only one slacking off.

Miku Kobato: Yeah, I’d feel anxious, like “Is it OK to do nothing?”, po. So, too much downtime is probably bad for us, po (laughs).

Misa: Yeah. That’s why I want to keep moving.

- To keep moving, you definitely want proper tours, and you definitely welcome a series of tie-in offers and the like. It’s just amazing. Even though it looks chaotic with a lot of events, everything you do ultimately works out perfectly. I think nothing is wasted.

Saiki: Everything we do feeds into who we are (laughs). I’m grateful for that.

- Will there ever come a day when you’re all like “No problem, it’s a piece of cake”, no matter what you do?

Miku Kobato: I don’t think that’ll happen, po. I mean, it’s just impossible given our personalities.

Akane: Right, probably never.

Saiki: Because a band without anyone like that at all, that is Band-Maid (all laugh).

Miku Kobato: It may be impossible, po, for us to become like that.

- That may be true. So, to keep moving forward for growth and evolution like this would be Band-Maid’s answer to “What is justice?”, isn’t it?

Miku Kobato: That’s right, po.

Saiki: Absolutely. For us, this is justice! (laughs)

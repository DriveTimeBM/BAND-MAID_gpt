Band-Maid, a hard rock band dressed in maid outfits, dropped the digital single Unleash!!!!!. The song fits the second round of their world domination, a goal they have been pursuing since their debut. They have refrained from doing in-person servings (concerts) during the COVID pandemic, but they will be going on a US tour from October on, and they are scheduled to do servings in Japan before that. Unleash!!!!! is exactly the concert anthem that unleashes them. We had an interview with two members of them, Saiki and Miku Kobato.

- When your previous single Sense was out, you said you did only song production in 2021. Now we are halfway through 2022, but did you keep writing songs in the first half of this year too?

Kobato: We’ve been writing songs following 2021, and before I knew it, half a year passed, po (laughs). However, this year, we have a US tour coming up in October, and we will be doing servings in Japan before that, so we are preparing for them, po.

- Do you practice and rehearse in the studio now?

Saiki: Yes, we do. We released a video on the “Day of Maid”, this May, where we played together in the studio for the first time in a while, and I thought I hadn’t heard this loud sound for a long time (laughs). After that, we started rehearsing there more and more, and I was like “I love being in the band!”

Kobato: We were out of control, like “Let’s play this song! Let’s play that song!”, po.

- This year, you also released BAND-MAID ACOUSTIC OKYU-JI CD, an acoustic album only for the fan club.

Kobato: It was the recording of the Online Acoustic Okyu-ji last year.

Saiki: The Online Acoustic Okyu-ji we did on Christmas was very well received and we received enthusiastic feedback, so we decided to release it as a recording.

- Were you surprised at the massive response?

Kobato: We were sure they would love it, po. However, we didn’t expect they would want it to be made into a recording, po.

Saiki: They loved it far beyond my expectations. We play hard rock, so I thought they must love hard sounds, but I found there are many people who genuinely love Band-Maid songs.

- The good melodies of Band-Maid songs come across more directly in acoustic, and above all, metalheads love ballads too.

Kobato: Ha ha ha (laughs).

Saiki: I talked a lot about that with the other members. Statistically, those who love metal also love ballads (laughs).

- I think you will get an awesome response if you have acoustic songs in a setlist on the US tour.

Kobato: Yes but the problem is the transportation of our acoustic guitars… Even electric guitars are handled so roughly that the whole case would be broken (laughs). I don’t think acoustic guitars can bear it, po.

Saiki: Our hearts would be broken.

- Ha ha ha, I see.

Saiki: We witnessed that before, right? We’ve become sensitive since then.

Kobato: The guitar fell straight from the above right in front of us, and we were like “Nooo!” (laughs) Seeing that gave us a strong sense of danger, po.

Saiki: However, I’d like to try an acoustic performance overseas. They sing along a lot even at ordinary servings. We stopped playing in the middle and sang Daydreaming together, right?

Kobato: Oh yeah, we did, po!

- Now we’d like to talk about the main topic. This time, the digital single Unleash!!!!! is released prior to the new EP Unleash coming in September, isn’t it?

Kobato: Yes, po. Unleash!!!!! has a theme of the second round of Band-Maid’s world domination, and we wanted to write a song to release our frustrations, like we weren’t able to do our activities even though we wanted because of the COVID regulations, po. We wrote it as a follow-up song to DOMINATION, which we released as the first round of world domination, po. We wanted a song where you can hear each instrument clearly like in DOMINATION, and Saiki also gave a specific request on it, po.

Saiki: Unleash!!!!! is the newest song on the EP. After we decided the direction of the EP, I talked with Kanami, like “Please write Unleash!!!!!”. I told her “I want a song with a sense of liberation, to show our determination and release our frustrations, while having highlights for each of us.”

- So, did Unleash!!!!! fall into place like the final puzzle piece of the EP?

Kobato: You’re right, po!

- The song itself is compact with only 3 minutes and 10 seconds, but its density and concentration are unbelievable. It’s a great listen!

Saiki: I feel like “Kanami, good job!” It also has elements we haven’t done before. I intentionally sang with falsetto at the very beginning, which was the first approach for me. The other members were also like “That’s nice!”

- Yes. Your falsetto in “How many times?” at the beginning is the heart of the song.

Saiki: I get so nervous at servings! The tempo is fast and the cue count goes by quickly. I occasionally fail to catch a cue between songs. I can’t help but imagine such negative things… (laughs)

Kobato: Once it starts, you can’t stop it until the end, it’s such a song, po! It’s fast like crazy, at 193 BPM, po (laughs). We didn’t have a song faster than 190 BPM where vocals stand out, while Screaming and BLACK HOLE start with instruments, so it’s new in that sense too, po.

- It’s the best how you sing “How many times?”, which sounds like a glitch in a good sense.

Saiki: Exactly! That’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to express I had reached my limit. I also intentionally used memorable Japanese words at the beginning of the chorus.

Kobato: We changed the vocal melody at the beginning of the chorus from the original, right?

Saiki: We started it one bar earlier than the demo.

Kobato: Yeah. Saiki was like “Isn’t this better?” and I was like “I think it’s nice, po!”

- Your rushed feelings are shown in the song, including your voice.

Kobato: It had our feelings like “We want to be unleashed!” as its base, which played a big role, po.

Saiki: As for the vocal recording of Unleash!!!!!, that was when we were very excited like “We want to do servings as soon as possible!”, so we recorded it in one take, while we recorded other songs in separate short takes.

- So did you put the momentum of live performance into the song?

Saiki: So I think that as the song progresses, my voice and Kobato’s voice come out more and more (laughs). I wanted to have a gradual crescendo feel, so we didn’t adjust that part in detail.

- I also like the lyrics with a storyline that starts with negative sentiments in the first half and then gradually feels positive.

Kobato: Yes, po. We two each wrote lyrics to it and kind of merged them, po. I’m repeating myself, but its theme is the second round of world domination, and its image is “Let’s release our frustrations that piled up during the COVID pandemic!”, po.

- Are your feelings during the pandemic reflected in the lines “Which is the best? / Good and evil, both extremes / Don’t waver, choose, play”? [Note: at 0:21]

Saiki: That’s right. The overall lyrics are based on what Kobato wrote, and the wording is based on what I wrote. The lyrics Kobato originally wrote were more intellectual. I broke them down and reconstructed them, kind of.

Kobato: We modified the lyrics quite a lot, so neither of us really remember how we wrote them, po (laughs). In “Which is the best?”, I think we wanted to convey the frustrations we had when we weren’t able to do our activities.

Saiki: It’s in the first half of the lyrics, so it’s the stage when we were still stuck in our shell.

Kobato: In the storyline of the lyrics, we had an image of going out of our shell in the first chorus, po.

- The onomatopoeia “Dan! Dan! Di, di, dan! Dan!” is also a nice hook. Who came up with this phrase?

Saiki: It was me. What was that, an onomatopoeia for some drums… I don’t remember well. It has an image of stomping the floor or hitting the ceiling. I used it also because it feels nice when I pronounce it. We wanted to break out of the shell we were trapped in, so it was like knocking on it. I wanted to make our action itself into sounds, or lyrics.

- So you wanted to include expressions that show your action.

Saiki: Yes. That makes it gorgeous and catchy.

- It can be taken as “dandan” [“gradually”] in Japanese, which also gives us a positive impression that you are moving forward.

Saiki: You’re right. I wanted to convey our excitement too. I find onomatopoeias useful because I can pack a lot of meanings in them. Unleash!!!!! is also new in terms of instruments, so it was fun when we played it in the studio. I don’t remember precisely, but there was a drumming phrase that made me wonder “What is she doing?” I thought Akane must have a hard time doing the difficult part.

Kobato: We don’t have time to listen to other instruments in this song, and if we did, we would fall behind, po (laughs). We have to match by practicing it until it becomes automatic, and it feels great when each of us get into the groove right, po.

- It seems this song will grow better and better in live performances.

Kobato: Yes, I think so, po! I think it will have a different vibe live. Also, if our masters and princesses sing along and get excited, I think it will have a different groove too.

- We would like to sing the line “How many times?” together, wouldn’t we?!

Saiki: Actually I’d like you to sing along now, though (laughs). I would be happy if you could sing along someday when you can.

- Lastly, you will perform at big festivals in August, namely Download Japan 2022 and Summer Sonic 2022.

Kobato: We’ll be doing in-person servings for the first time in two years and a half, so we feel like “Nice to meet you” rather than “Long time no see”, po (laughs). We’ve done several online okyu-ji with no audience, but in-person ones are different, you know. We’ve become accustomed to online okyu-ji, so we are nervous ourselves and actually we feel like “Will we be OK?”, po. Download Japan 2022 will be the first in-person serving in a while, po.

- It’s amazing your first in-person serving in a while will be the metal festival Download Japan 2022 (laughs).

Saiki: I’m really surprised. Moreover, we are the only Japanese artists there. I was wondering “Will there be more bands like us when it gets closer?” though (laughs). We will do our best!

Kobato: We are thinking of a very aggressive setlist, po!

Saiki: Yes! It’s a setlist I’ve been thinking about for a long time, so I hope you will look forward to it. We haven’t had good timing to do it before, and I was like “I think it will be OK at Download Japan 2022!” (laughs) I think you will be like “Do you blow us away with this setlist after two years and a half?!”

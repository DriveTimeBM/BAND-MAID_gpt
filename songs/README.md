## üìù Notes ##

Translation Rule: Always use the official title listed in the Name column. Do not translate or alter capitalization or punctuation.

Dynamic Data: Spotify Streams and Live Count change over time. Keep a note of the snapshot date when exporting.

Fan Usage: Alternative names (Alternative Name) are useful for translation, since fans or Japanese media may reference those.

BAND-MAIKO: All BAND-MAIKO songs are self-covers of previously released BAND-MAID songs with the exception of "Gion-cho" which has no BAND-MAID predecessor.

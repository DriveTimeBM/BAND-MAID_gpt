## üìù Notes ##

Translation Rules: Use the word word in Translation exactly as listed. Do not re-translate terms (e.g., always use Okyuji, not ‚Äúserving‚Äù).

Romaji Preference: Many BAND-MAID-specific terms should remain in Romaji to match fan usage.

Coverage: Includes member names, nicknames, slogans, recurring jokes, cultural terms, and special project names.

Expansion: Song titles, album names, tours, and additional fan slang should be added here to ensure translation consistency.

Okyūji is how they call their live shows. It is written as お給仕 in Japanese which means a serving (to customers).

**What is the fandom name of BAND-MAID?**
BAND-MAID doesn't have an official fandom name. The band members always address the fans as "Masters and Princesses". Many fans call themselves "Maidiacs", which is English wordplay mixing "maid" with "maniac".

**Why Miku says "po"?**
Miku’s last name, Kobato (小鳩) is composed of two kanjis: one meaning small (小) and the other meaning pigeon/dove (鳩). Hence Kobato can also mean “small pigeon/dove”. She adopted the pigeon persona to match that. In Japanese language, the onomatopoeic sound that pigeons/doves make is kuruppo (くるっぽ) or simply po (ぽ). So Kobato makes that sound too.

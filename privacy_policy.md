# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-10-01

## TL;DR

I don’t collect, store, or sell your data—period. This GPT reads publicly hosted files from GitHub. I have **no visibility** into who you are or what you type into ChatGPT.

## Who “I” am

This policy covers the custom GPT published by **Al (DriveTimeBM)** and any content it fetches from GitHub repositories I control.

## What this GPT does

- Loads static content (e.g., Markdown, JSON, CSV, images) hosted on GitHub/GitHub Pages.
- Uses that content to answer your questions inside ChatGPT.

## Data I collect

- **None.**  
  
  I do not run any servers, databases, analytics, cookies, or tracking. I do not receive logs of your prompts, IP address, browser info, or anything else.

## Data processed by others

- **OpenAI (ChatGPT):** Your prompts and the model’s responses are processed by OpenAI. I do not see them. For details, see OpenAI’s policies:  
  - [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)  
  - [ChatGPT Terms](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use)
- **GitHub/GitHub Pages:** Content this GPT reads is hosted on GitHub. GitHub may collect standard request logs (e.g., IP address) when your browser or OpenAI’s servers fetch files from GitHub Pages or `raw.githubusercontent.com`. I do not receive these logs. See:  
  - [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

## Cookies & tracking

- I set **no cookies** and embed no trackers.  
- GitHub Pages or OpenAI may set their own cookies or collect telemetry per their policies.

## Retention

- I retain **nothing**.  
- OpenAI and GitHub handle their own retention under their respective policies.

## Children’s privacy

This GPT is not directed to children under 13 (or the age of digital consent in your region). I do not knowingly collect any personal data.

## Your rights

If you want to access, delete, or export your ChatGPT data, use OpenAI’s tools. I cannot identify you and have nothing to access or delete on my side.

## Security

There’s no user database here to secure. Hosted files are public on GitHub. For GitHub and OpenAI platform security, see their documentation.

## International use

Your data may be processed by OpenAI and/or GitHub on servers outside your country. I don’t control that infrastructure.

## Changes to this policy

If I ever change how this GPT works or starts collecting data (unlikely), I’ll update this document with a new effective date.
